This is the technical documentation for the Agentuity Cloud, which covers:

- General cloud and account information (docs stored in /content/Cloud)
- The CLI (/content/CLI)
- Examples, tutorials, samples (/content/Examples)
- And the different SDKs (/content/SDKs)

This doc app is a NextJS app built on top of Fumadocs (https://fumadocs.vercel.app/docs/ui).

This project also contains the agent the powers RAG and Tutorials. Those agents live in `/agent-docs` directory.
To run the agent server locally, go into that directory with `cd agent-docs` and then start the agent with `agentuity dev`.
To run the NextJS app, do `npm run dev` in the root of this repository. You will want to start these two apps in separate repositories.
