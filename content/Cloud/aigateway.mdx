## Viewing Your Session Usage

When you navigate to the AI Gateway > Sessions page in the Cloud Console, you'll see a table listing all your sessions with the following information:

- **Agent**: The name of your agent
- **Provider**: The AI provider used for the session
- **Model**: The model used for the session
- **LLM Cost**: The cost of the LLM used for the session
- **Timestamp**: The session timestamp

You can filter the list of sessions using the search box at the top of the table to quickly find specific specific sessions or filter by properties such as provider.

## Session Detail

You can select a key value instance to view and manage its data.

## AI Gateway Usage

By default, when your agent is not configured to use a specific AI provider using the override, it will use the AI Gateway to route requests to the appropriate providera automatically.

To override using the AI Gateway, use the AI provider specific environment variables to configure them. 

For example, to use the OpenAI API and use your own API key, you can set the provider API Gateway in the `.env` file of your agent project:


```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

When you deploy your agent projet, your agent will use the OpenAI API directly instead of the AI Gateway.

Each AI Provider uses their own API Key and configuration. Please consult the documentation for your specific provider to learn how to set up the API Key.
