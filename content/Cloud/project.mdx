## Projects Overview

The project dashboard provides a list of your agent projects. This page helps you monitor your projects's status, usage metrics, and recent activity.

### Project Settings

#### Environment Variables & Secrets

You can manage environment variables and secrets for your project in the Project > Settings page.

<ThemeImage baseName="project-env" alt="Project Environment Variables"  />

In addition to environment variables, you can also view your Project API Key and the SDK Key.


You can also manage your environment variables and secrets from the CLI using the following command:

```bash
agentuity env set <key> <value>
```

Use `--help` to see other options.

You can `get`, `delete`, `list` and `set` environment variables and secrets using the CLI.

When setting an environment variable or secret, the CLI will attempt to determine the type of the value and set it accordingly. However, you can force the value to be a secret by using the `--secret` flag.

The `.env` file is a special file that is used to store environment variables and secrets for your project. It is a simple text file that contains key-value pairs.  The `.env` file is automatically loaded when you run the CLI but not used (or not uploaded) in production.

If you would like to have different environment variables and secrets for development and production, you can use the `.env.development` file which will override values in the `.env` file when running `agentuity dev`.

<Callout type="warn">
  The `.env` file must not be committed to your source code repository as it contains sensitive information. By default, an agentuity project will exclude this file and others like it in the `.gitignore` file if you use the `agentuity new` command to create your project.
</Callout>

##### API Keys

There are two automatically generated API keys for your project:

- **Project API Key** (the environment variable is `AGENTUITY_PROJECT_API_KEY`)
- **SDK Key** (the environment variable is `AGENTUITY_SDK_KEY`)

The Project API Key is used to authenticate requests to the Agentuity API. You can view your Project API Key in the Project > Settings page.

The SDK Key is used to authenticate requests to the Agentuity SDK from your agents when running in development mode. You can view your SDK Key in the Project > Settings page.

Both keys are created automatically when you create a new project and stored in the project's `.env` file.

You can create additional API keys for your project in the [Settings > API Keys page](./api-keys).
