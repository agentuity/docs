## Understanding Object Storage

Object storage is designed for storing files, media, and unstructured data, making it ideal for:

- Files and documents
- Images and videos
- Backups and archives
- Static assets
- Large binary data
- Public content delivery

## Viewing Your Object Storage Buckets

When you navigate to the Services > Object Store page in the Cloud Console, you'll see a table listing all your object storage buckets with the following information:

- **Bucket Name**: The name of your object storage bucket
- **Provider**: The storage provider for the bucket
- **Created At**: When the bucket was created
- **Size**: The storage size used by the bucket
- **Num. of Objects**: The number of objects stored in the bucket

You can filter the list of buckets using the search box at the top of the table to quickly find specific buckets by name.

## Creating a New Object Storage Bucket

There are two ways to create a new object storage bucket:

1. From the Services > Object Store page in the Cloud Console
2. In code, using the Agentuity SDK

When creating an object storage bucket from the Cloud Console, click the **Create Storage** button and select **Object Store** from the storage type options. You can also choose your preferred storage provider from the dropdown menu, including Agentuity's built-in storage, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.
