## Agent Dashboard Overview

The agent dashboard provides a list of your agents. This page helps you monitor your agent's status, usage metrics, and recent activity.

<ThemeImage baseName="agents" alt="Agent Dashboard"  />

### Managing an Agent

You can select a specific agent to view and manage its details.  The agent detail page provides a list of the agent's inputs and outputs, recent sessions and overview of costs.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-detail" alt="Agent Detail"  />

### Agent Input & Output

Agents receive data from various sources and send data to various destinations (input and output, or we call it IO).

"/>

You can think of the agent as an intelligent black box that receives data from sources and responds with data which is sent to the configured destinations.

Read the [Agent IO](/Guides/agent-io) guide for more information.

You can add a new input or output by clicking the plus button in the agent IO visualization.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-new" alt="Agent New IO"  />

When you agent is invoked, it will process the data and send the output to the output destination.

The agent request object will contain a property called `trigger` that will contain the source that triggered the agent. You can use this to determine the source of the data and process it accordingly. This is particularly useful when you are using multiple sources to trigger the same agent.

<CodeExample js={`import type { AgentContext, AgentRequest, AgentResponse } from '@agentuity/sdk';

export default async function Agent(
   req: AgentRequest,
   resp: AgentResponse,
   ctx: AgentContext
) {
    ctx.logger.info('trigger was %s', req.trigger);
    return resp.text("ok");
}`} py={`from agentuity import AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext

async def run(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext):
    context.logger.info('trigger was %s', request.trigger)
    return response.text("ok")
`} />

#### Webhook Source

To configure your agent to receive data from a webhook, you need to add a new webhook source.  When receiving data from a webhook, the agent will send the data to the agent's inputs asynchronously without waiting for the agent to finish processing the data.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-webhook-source" alt="Agent New Webhook Source"  />

For Webhook sources, you can require authorization to access the webhook.  This is useful if you want to protect your webhook from unauthorized access.

The following authentication methods are supported:

| Type    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Project | Authenticated using the project API Key |
| Public  | No authentication required - webhook is publicly accessible |
| Bearer  | Authenticated using Bearer Token via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header |
| Basic   | Authenticated using Basic Auth via `Authorization: Basic <username>:<password>` header |
| Header  | Authenticated using custom header via `<key>: <value>` header |

When using the Bearer, Basic or Header authentication methods, you can specify the authentication values for each agent.

To trigger a webhook using curl with a required Bearer token authentication, you can use the following command:

<CLICommand command={`curl https://agentuity.ai/webhook/agent_1234567890abcdef \\\n\t-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\\n\t--json '{"some":"data"}'`} />

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to use the correct agent ID in the webhook URL.
</Callout>

The response from the webhook will contain an informational message if successful.  Additionally, the `Location` header will contain the URL that can be used to read the agent output.  This URL will block until the agent has started streaming the output response.

#### API Source

To configure your agent to receive data as an API endpoint, you need to add a new API source.  When receiving data from an API endpoint, the agent will send the data to the agent's inputs synchronously and wait for the agent to respond.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-api-source" alt="Agent New API Source"  />

For API sources, you can require authorization to access the API.  This is useful if you want to protect your API from unauthorized access.

The following authentication methods are supported:

| Type    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Project | Authenticated using the project API Key |
| Public  | No authentication required - webhook is publicly accessible |
| Bearer  | Authenticated using Bearer Token via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header |
| Basic   | Authenticated using Basic Auth via `Authorization: Basic <username>:<password>` header |
| Header  | Authenticated using custom header via `<key>: <value>` header |

When using the Bearer, Basic or Header authentication methods, you can specify the authentication values for each agent.

When you plan on using the API source, it is recommended that you stream data to and from the agent.

To invoke an API using curl with a required Bearer token authentication, you can use the following command:

<CLICommand command={`curl https://agentuity.ai/api/agent_1234567890abcdef \\\n\t-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\\n\t--json '{"some":"data"}'`} />

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to use the correct agent ID in the webhook URL.
</Callout>

#### Email Source

For Email sources, you can configure your agent at a unique agent email address.  When receiving an email, the agent will send the email content to the agent's inputs asynchronously without waiting for the agent to finish processing the email.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-email-source" alt="Agent New Email Source"  />

<Callout type="info">
  An email source can only be triggered by an email sent to the agent's email address and not via the API.
</Callout>

After an email is received, the platform will enqueue processing and your agent will handle the message asynchronously. Any replies will be delivered via the configured destination(s).

#### Discord Source

For Discord sources, you can configure your agent to receive messages from a Discord server. When a user tags the bot in a Discord message, the agent will receive the message content asynchronously without waiting for the agent to finish processing the message.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-discord-source" alt="Agent New Discord Source"  />

<Callout type="info">
  You must have a Discord account linked to your Agentuity account to use Discord Integration. The bot must be invited to your Discord server before it can receive messages.
</Callout>

**Prerequisite: Connecting Your Account**

Before configuring a Discord source, you must first link your personal Discord account to Agentuity. This one-time setup allows Agentuity to see your available servers.

1.  Click your user profile name in the bottom-left corner of the App.
2.  Select **Account** from the menu that appears.
3.  In your Profile settings, find the **Connected accounts** section and click the **Connect account** button to add Discord.
4.  Follow the authorization flow in the pop-up window to grant the requested permissions.

**Configuration Steps**

To set up Discord Integration:

1. **Add Discord IO**: Click the plus button in the agent IO visualization and select Discord
2. **Select Server**: Choose a Discord server from your connected servers
3. **Invite Bot**: If the bot isn't already in the server, use the provided invite link to add the Agentuity bot to your Discord server
4. **Tag Bot**: Once configured, tag the bot (@Agentuity) in Discord messages to forward them to your agent

The Discord Integration provides the following data when a message is forwarded:

- **Message Content**: The text content of the Discord message
- **Author Information**: Username and user ID of the message author
- **Server Context**: Guild ID and channel ID
- **Message ID**: Unique identifier for the Discord message

When your agent receives a Discord message, you can access the Discord-specific data through the request object:

<CodeExample js={`import type { AgentContext, AgentRequest, AgentResponse } from '@agentuity/sdk';

export default async function Agent(
   req: AgentRequest,
   resp: AgentResponse,
   ctx: AgentContext
) {
    // Check if this was triggered by Discord
    if (req.trigger === 'discord') {
        const messageData = await req.data.discord();
        
        ctx.logger.info('Discord message from %s: %s', 
            messageData.username, 
            messageData.content
        );
        
        // Access server and channel info
        ctx.logger.info('Guild: %s, Channel: %s, Message: %s', 
            messageData.guildId, 
            messageData.channelId,
            messageData.messageId
        );
        
        return resp.text(\`Hello \${messageData.username}! I received your message.\`);
    }
    
    return resp.text("Hello from Discord bot!");
}`} py={`from agentuity import AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext

async def run(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext):
    # Check if this was triggered by Discord
    if request.trigger == 'discord':
        message_data = await request.data.discord()
        
        context.logger.info('Discord message from %s: %s', 
            message_data['username'], 
            message_data['content']
        )
        
        # Access server and channel info
        context.logger.info('Guild: %s, Channel: %s, Message: %s', 
            message_data['guildId'], 
            message_data['channelId'],
            message_data['messageId']
        )
        
        return response.text(f"Hello {message_data['username']}! I received your message.")
    
    return response.text("Hello from Discord bot!")
`} />

<Callout type="warn">
  Discord sources can only be triggered by messages where the bot is tagged in a Discord server. The bot cannot receive all messages in a channel for privacy reasons.
</Callout>

{/* #### Slack Source

For Slack sources, you can configure your agent to receive messages from a Slack workspace. Users @mention your agent in Slack to trigger responses. By default, replies are sent as threads (configurable).

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-slack-source" alt="Agent New Slack Source" />

To set up Slack Integration, you'll need to create a Slack App and configure OAuth:

1. **Create a Slack App** in your Slack workspace
2. **Configure OAuth** with the following credentials:
   - App Name
   - Client ID 
   - Client Secret
   - Signing Secret
3. **Set OAuth Redirect URL** to: `https://api.agentuity.com/io/slack/source/oauth/callback`
4. **Configure Event Subscriptions** with the Request URL provided by Agentuity
5. **Subscribe to Bot Events**: `message.channels`, `message.im`, `app_mention`

<Callout type="info">
  You must configure OAuth and Event Subscriptions in your Slack App settings for the integration to work properly.
</Callout> */}

#### Telegram Source

For Telegram sources, you can configure your agent to receive messages from Telegram users. Users can message your agent directly on Telegram.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-telegram-source" alt="Agent New Telegram Source" />

To configure a Telegram source:

1. **Get a Bot Token** from @BotFather on Telegram
2. **Enter the Bot Token** in the configuration

#### SMS Source

For SMS sources, you can connect your Twilio account to allow your agent to be triggered by incoming text messages. This requires providing your Twilio API credentials.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-sms-source" alt="Agent New SMS Source" />

To configure an SMS source, you will need the following credentials from your Twilio console:
- **Account SID**
- **API SID**
- **API Secret**

Once validated, you can select one or more of your Twilio numbers to forward incoming messages to your agent.

#### Schedule Source

For running an agent on a schedule, you can configure your agent to use a cron source.  When the agent is scheduled to run, the agent will send the data to the agent's inputs asynchronously without waiting for the agent to finish processing the data.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-cron-source" alt="Agent New Schedule Source"  />

When creating a new schedule, you can specify the cron expression to run the agent.  The cron expression is a string that represents the schedule to run the agent.

<div className="flex items-center justify-start gap-2">Click the sparkle icon <Sparkle /> to help you create a new cron expression using AI.</div>

You can optionally specify a content type and payload to send to the agent when the agent is scheduled to run.

A cron source can only be triggered internally by the Agentuity Platform and not via the API. However, you can trigger a scheduled agent to run by selecting the schedule and selecting "Manual Run" in the context menu.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-cron-trigger" alt="Trigger Cron Manually"  />

#### Discord Destination

For Discord destinations, you can configure your agent to send messages to a Discord channel when triggered by external sources (webhooks, APIs, other agents, etc.). This is different from Discord sources which handle @mentions within Discord.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-discord-destination" alt="Discord Destination Configuration" />

To configure a Discord destination:

1. **Select a Discord Server** from your connected servers
2. **Choose a Channel** where messages will be sent
3. **Invite the Bot** if not already in the server using the provided invite link

<Callout type="info">
  The bot must be invited to your Discord server before you can configure it as a destination. Use the invite link provided if you see "Bot not found in server" error.
</Callout>

#### Email Destination

For Email destinations, you can configure your agent to send emails when triggered.

By default, emails are sent from `no-reply@agentuity.run`:

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-email-destination" alt="Email Destination - Default Configuration" />

When you also configure Email as a source (inbound), your agent gets a dedicated email address that can be used as well:

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-io-email-dest-inbound" alt="Email Destination with Inbound Email Configured" />

All in all, there are three sender address options:

- **Default**: Sends from `no-reply@agentuity.run`
- **With Inbound Email**: Sends from your agent's address `[agent-id]@agentuity.run`
- **Custom Domain** (Enterprise): Use your organization's domain for outbound emails

Configuration requires:
- **Recipient Addresses**: List of email addresses to send to
- **Subject Line**: Email subject for outbound messages

> Note: Email subject and recipients can only be configured through the UI at this time.

<Callout type="info">
  **Enterprise Feature:** Organizations can configure custom email domains for outbound emails. This requires DNS configuration and is currently only available through Agentuity support. Contact us to set up custom email domains for your organization.
</Callout>

### Agent Deployments

Agentuity supports continuous deployment using a native GitHub App integration and a GitHub Actions workflow.

#### GitHub App Integration

The GitHub App integration is a native integration that allows you to deploy your agents to the Agentuity Platform from your GitHub repository.

To enable the GitHub App integration, you need to provide permission for Agentuity to access your GitHub account. On your Project Settings page, you can find the GitHub App integration.

<ThemeImage baseName="project-integration" alt="Project Integrations"  />

Once connected, each Project can be configured to deploy from a specific GitHub repository automatically.

<ThemeImage baseName="project-integration-github" alt="Project GitHub Integration"  />

When a new commit is pushed to the repository, the GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered and the agent will be deployed to the Agentuity Platform.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-deployment" alt="Agent Deployment"  />

You can select a specific deployment to view the deployment details including logs.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-deployment-detail" alt="Agent Deployment Detail"  />

When using GitHub to deploy (either the GitHub App or the GitHub Actions workflow), your GitHub commit information will be displayed in the deployment details.

You can see all the projects that are connected to your GitHub account in the Settings > Integrations section.

<ThemeImage baseName="settings-integration-github" alt="GitHub Settings"  />

From here you can disconnect a specific project from your GitHub account or disconnect Agentuity from your GitHub account.

#### GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is a native integration that allows you to deploy your agents to the Agentuity Platform from your GitHub repository using GitHub Actions.

You can install the GitHub Actions workflow by visiting the [Agentuity GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/agentuity-deploy-action) and clicking the "Install" button.

<ThemeImage baseName="github-action" alt="GitHub Actions Workflow"  />

You can also directly use the [Agentuity GitHub Actions](https://github.com/agentuity/deploy-action) repository to deploy your agents to the Agentuity Platform.

#### Manual Deployment

You can also manually deploy your agents to the Agentuity Platform with the CLI using the following command:

<CLICommand command="agentuity deploy" />

By default, the CLI will use the `latest` tag to deploy your agents. You can specify one or more tags to deploy by using the `--tag` flag.  The active deployment will only be used for agent requests based on the `latest` tag.

You can test new versions of your agents by using the `--tag` flag to specify a specific tag and then using the tag in either the `webhook` or `api` source.

For example, if you have a tag called `v1.0.0`, you can use the following command to deploy it:

<CLICommand command="agentuity deploy --tag v1.0.0" />

This will tag the deployment with the `v1.0.0` tag but not make it the active deployment.

You can the invoke the agent with the `v1.0.0` tag by using curl with the following command:

<CLICommand command={`curl https://agentuity.ai/api/agent_1234567890abcdef/v1.0.0 \\\n\t-H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \\\n\t--json '{"some":"data"}'`} />

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to use the correct agent ID and tag in the API URL. Also, make sure to use the correct authentication token and that you have configured the API source.
</Callout>

#### Rollback & Delete

You can rollback to a previous deployment by using the CLI with the following command:

<CLICommand command="agentuity rollback" />

If you would like to delete the deployment in addition to rolling back, you can use the `--delete` flag.

<ThemeImage baseName="cli-rollback" alt="CI Rollback"  />

You can select a specific deployment:

<ThemeImage baseName="cli-rollback-detail" alt="CI Rollback"  />

### Agent Logs

You can view the logs for a specific agent by selecting the agent and then clicking the "Logs" tab.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-logs" alt="Agent Logs"  />

If you select a specific log, you can view the log detail for the specific log entry.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-logs-detail" alt="Agent Logs Detail"  />

### Agent Sessions

The sessions dashboard provides a list of your agent sessions. This page helps you monitor your agent's status, usage metrics, and recent activity.

<ThemeImage baseName="sessions" alt="Agent Sessions"  />

If you select a specific session, you can view the session detail for the specific session.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-session-detail" alt="Agent Session Detail"  />

If you select a specific span, a session span trace detail will be displayed with specific detail about the execution of the span.

<ThemeImage baseName="agent-session-detail-sidebar" alt="Agent Session Detail Sidebar"  />

## CLI

You can use the CLI to manage your agents using the following command:

<CLICommand command="agentuity agent" />

See the [CLI documentation](/CLI/agent) for more information on specific command usage and flags.
