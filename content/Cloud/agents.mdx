## Agent Dashboard

The agent dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your agent, including status, creation date, deployment information, LLM models in use, and cost tracking.

### Agent Information
The top section of the dashboard displays:
- Agent status (Active/Inactive)
- Creation date
- Last updated and deployment dates
- LLM models being used by the agent

### Cost & Usage Tracking
This section provides detailed metrics about your agent's usage:
- Total cost accumulated
- LLM cost (portion of the total cost spent on language model calls)
- Input tokens processed
- Output tokens generated

### Recent Activity
The activity section shows a table of recent sessions for your agent, including:
- Session status (Pending, Completed, Error)
- Duration of each session
- Cost per session
- When the session started

### I/O Visualization
The I/O visualization shows how your agent connects to various inputs and outputs. This visual representation helps you understand the flow of data through your agent.

## Calling Deployed Agents

Once you've deployed an agent to Agentuity Cloud, you can integrate it with your applications by calling it via webhooks.

### Finding Your Agent's Webhook URL

1. Navigate to your agent's dashboard in the Agentuity Cloud Console
2. Click on the "Connections" tab or the webhook icon in the I/O visualization
3. In the "Inbound Webhook" modal, you'll find the webhook URL for your agent

### Authorization Types

When configuring your webhook, you can choose from the following authorization types:

- **Public**: The webhook is publicly accessible without authentication
- **Bearer Token**: Requires a bearer token for authentication
- **API Key**: Requires an API key for authentication

### Enabling/Disabling Webhooks

You can enable or disable webhook access to your agent using the toggle switch in the "Inbound Webhook" modal.

### Example: Calling an Agent with cURL

For a publicly accessible webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://agent-url.agentuity.cloud/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello from cURL!"}'
```

With bearer token authentication:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://agent-url.agentuity.cloud/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello from cURL!"}'
```

With API key authentication:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://agent-url.agentuity.cloud/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello from cURL!"}'
```
