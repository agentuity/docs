# Agentuity Cloud Console

The Agentuity Cloud Console is a web-based interface for managing your Agentuity resources, projects, and settings. This guide provides an overview of the main features and functionality available in the Cloud Console.

## Getting Started

The Cloud Console allows you to:

- Create and manage projects
- Configure settings and API keys
- Manage memory storage (Vector and Key-Value)
- Monitor agent deployments and runs
- View logs and telemetry data

## Console Sections

### Project Management

The [Project Management](/Cloud/console/projects) section allows you to create, view, and manage your projects. Key features include:

- Project creation and configuration
- Resource usage monitoring
- Agent management
- Run tracking
- Deployment management
- Project settings

Learn more in the [Project Management documentation](/Cloud/console/projects).

### Memory Storage

The Memory Storage section provides tools for managing different types of memory storage:

- **[Vector Memory Storage](/Cloud/console/vector-memory)**: For semantic search and large context windows, ideal for knowledge bases and historical data
- **Key-Value Storage**: For fast, simple, or temporary data storage

Learn more in the [Vector Memory Storage documentation](/Cloud/console/vector-memory) or [Key-Value Storage documentation](/Cloud/console/key-value-memory).

### Settings and Configuration

The Settings section allows you to manage various configuration options:

- **[API Keys](/Cloud/console/api-keys)**: Create and manage API keys for authenticating with Agentuity services
- **[Organization Settings](/Cloud/console/organization)**: Manage organization details and members

Learn more in the [API Keys documentation](/Cloud/console/api-keys), [Organization Settings documentation](/Cloud/console/organization) (coming soon), or [User Profile documentation](/Cloud/console/profile) (coming soon).

## Navigation

The Cloud Console features a sidebar navigation menu that provides access to all major sections:

- **Projects**: View and manage all your projects
- **Memory**: Access Vector and Key-Value storage options
- **Settings**: Configure API keys, organization settings, and user profile

## Common Tasks

Here are some common tasks you can perform in the Cloud Console:

- [Creating a new project](/Cloud/console/projects#creating-a-new-project)
- [Managing project settings](/Cloud/console/projects#project-settings)
- [Creating API keys](/Cloud/console/api-keys#creating-a-new-api-key)
- [Setting up vector memory storage](/Cloud/console/vector-memory#creating-a-new-vector-instance)

## Best Practices

- Regularly review resource usage and clean up unused resources
- Use descriptive names for projects, API keys, and memory instances
- Follow security best practices for API key management
- Organize projects by use case or environment
