The Agentuity Cloud Console is a web-based interface for managing your Agentuity resources, projects, and settings. This guide provides an overview of the main features and functionality available in the Cloud Console.

## What You Can Do in the Cloud Console

The Cloud Console serves as your **mission control** for AI agent operations, providing:

- **[Project Management](/Cloud/project)** - Create, configure, and manage AI agent projects
- **[API Key Management](/Cloud/api-keys)** - Generate and manage authentication keys for your agents
- **[Agentic Services](/Cloud/vector-memory)** - Access vector memory, key-value storage, and AI gateway
- **[Agent Monitoring](/Cloud/agents)** - Monitor deployments, runs, and performance metrics
- **[Session Analytics](/Cloud/sessions)** - View detailed logs and telemetry data

## Core Agentic Services

### [Vector Memory Storage](/Cloud/vector-memory)
**Best for:** Semantic search, knowledge bases, RAG applications, long-term memory

Vector Memory enables your agents to store and retrieve information based on semantic similarity rather than exact matches. Perfect for:
- **Knowledge bases** that agents can search intelligently
- **Historical context** that agents need to remember across sessions
- **Document retrieval** for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) workflows
- **Large context windows** that exceed LLM token limits

### [Key-Value Storage](/Cloud/key-value-memory)  
**Best for:** Fast data access, caching, session state, temporary storage

Key-Value Storage provides lightning-fast data retrieval for agents that need quick access to structured data:
- **Session state** and user preferences
- **Caching** frequently accessed data
- **Configuration settings** for agent behavior
- **Temporary data** that doesn't need long-term persistence

### [AI Gateway](/Cloud/aigateway)
**Best for:** Multi-model access, usage tracking, cost management, rate limiting

AI Gateway centralizes access to multiple LLM providers with unified billing and monitoring:
- **Multi-provider access** to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more
- **Usage tracking** and cost optimization
- **Rate limiting** and quota management
- **Unified billing** across all AI model usage

## Settings and Configuration

### [API Keys](/Cloud/api-keys)
Secure authentication for your agents and applications:
- Generate API keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Set permissions and scopes for each key
- Monitor API key usage and rotate keys for security

### [Organization Settings](/Cloud/organization)
Team collaboration and management:
- Invite team members and manage permissions
- Configure organization-wide settings and policies
- Monitor team usage and billing across projects

### User Profile
Personal account management:
- Update your profile information and preferences
- Configure notification settings
- Manage your personal API access
