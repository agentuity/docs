## Understanding Key-Value Memory Storage

Key-value memory storage is designed for fast, simple, or temporary data storage, making it ideal for:

- Session data
- Configuration settings
- Caching
- Temporary state management
- Simple data structures
- Sharing state between agents

## Viewing Your Key-Value Instances

When you navigate to the Memory > Key-Value page in the Cloud Console, you'll see a table listing all your key-value instances with the following information:

- **Name**: The name of your key-value instance
- **Size**: The storage size used by the key-value instance

You can filter the list of key-value instances using the search box at the top of the table to quickly find specific instances by name.

## Creating a New Key-Value Instance

There are two ways to create a new key-value instance:

1. From the Memory > Key-Value page in the Cloud Console
2. In code, using the Agentuity SDK
