## Understanding Key Value Storage

Key value memory storage is designed for fast, simple, or temporary data storage, making it ideal for:

- Session data
- Configuration settings
- Caching
- Temporary state management
- Simple data structures
- Sharing state between agents

## Viewing Your Key Value Instances

When you navigate to the Memory > Key Value page in the Cloud Console, you'll see a table listing all your key value instances with the following information:

- **Name**: The name of your key value instance
- **Size**: The storage size used by the key value instance

You can filter the list of key value instances using the search box at the top of the table to quickly find specific instances by name.

## View Key Value Data

You can select a key value instance to view and manage its data.
