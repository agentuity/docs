## Understanding Vector Memory Storage

Vector memory storage is designed for semantic search and large context windows, making it ideal for:

- Knowledge bases
- Historical data
- Semantic search applications
- Applications requiring understanding of content meaning
- Long-term memory for agents

## Viewing Your Vector Instances

When you navigate to the Memory > Vector page in the Cloud Console, you'll see a table listing all your vector instances with the following information:

- **Name**: The name of your vector instance
- **Size**: The storage size used by the vector instance

You can filter the list of vector instances using the search box at the top of the table to quickly find specific instances by name.

## Creating a New Vector Instance

There are two ways to create a new vector instance:

1. From the Memory > Vector page in the Cloud Console
2. In code, using the Agentuity SDK


### Using Vector Memory in Agents

When working within an agent context, you can access vector memory storage directly through the context object:

```javascript
export default async function Agent(
  req: AgentRequest,
  resp: AgentResponse,
  ctx: AgentContext,
) {
  // Store data in vector memory
  const ids = await ctx.vector.upsert('my-vector-instance', {
    text: 'This is some text to store',
    metadata: { source: 'example' }
  });
  
  // Search vector memory
  const results = await ctx.vector.search('my-vector-instance', {
    query: 'search query',
    limit: 5
  });
  
  // Delete vectors from vector memory
  const deletedCount = await ctx.vector.delete('my-vector-instance', 'vector-id-1', 'vector-id-2');
}
```
