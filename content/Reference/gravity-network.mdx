The Gravity Network is Agentuity's infrastructure layer that powers all platform services. Rather than building monolithic, tightly-coupled systems, we've architected everything as composable primitives that stack on top of each other.

## Layered Architecture

Agentuity is built on a layered primitive model. Each layer provides building blocks for the layers above it, creating a flexible and powerful foundation.

### Layer 1: Core Primitives

At the foundation, we have three core primitives that nearly everything else is built upon:

| Primitive | Purpose | Examples |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| **Storage** | S3-compatible object storage | File uploads, snapshots, assets |
| **Postgres** | Transactional database | Metadata, state, configuration |
| **Compute** | Agent runtime and sandboxes | Agent execution, isolated code runs |
| **OLAP Warehouse** <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground ml-1">(coming soon)</span> | Analytical database | Logs, metrics, analytics |

These core primitives are intentionally generic and protocol-based. Storage speaks S3. Databases speak standard wire protocols. This design enables portability and flexibility at the infrastructure level.

### Layer 2: Platform Primitives

On top of the core primitives, we build higher-level platform primitives:

| Primitive | Built On | Purpose |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| <Database className="inline w-4 h-4 mr-1" /> [**Database**](https://app.agentuity.com/services/database) | Postgres | Managed database access |
| <DatabaseZap className="inline w-4 h-4 mr-1" /> [**Key Value**](https://app.agentuity.com/services/kv) | Postgres | Fast state storage |
| <BookText className="inline w-4 h-4 mr-1" /> [**Vector**](https://app.agentuity.com/services/vector) | Postgres | Semantic search |
| <ListTodo className="inline w-4 h-4 mr-1" /> [**Queue**](https://app.agentuity.com/services/queue) | Postgres | Reliable message delivery |
| <Container className="inline w-4 h-4 mr-1" /> [**Sandbox**](https://app.agentuity.com/services/sandbox) | Compute + Storage | Isolated code execution |
| <Radio className="inline w-4 h-4 mr-1" /> [**Durable Stream**](https://app.agentuity.com/services/stream) | Storage | Persistent message streams |
| **Agent Runtime** | Compute | Agent execution environment |
| **Observability** | Warehouse | Logging, tracing, metrics |

These primitives use the Layer 1 building blocks but don't depend on each other horizontally. They only reach down the stack, never up.

### Layer 3: Application Services

The highest layer provides application-level services that combine multiple Layer 2 primitives:

| Service | Built On | Purpose |
| ------- | -------- | ------- |
| **Auth** | Database | User authentication and sessions |
| **Webhooks** <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground ml-1">(coming soon)</span> | Queues + Compute | Receive external events |
| **Scheduling** <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground ml-1">(coming soon)</span> | Queues + Compute | Cron and delayed execution |
| **Email** <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground ml-1">(coming soon)</span> | Webhooks + Queues | Inbound/outbound email handling |
| **App Analytics** | OLAP Warehouse | Metrics, dashboards, insights |

For example, an inbound email service works like this:
1. Email arrives at the Agentuity email service
2. The email is processed by a preconfigured webhook
3. An event is placed on the queue
4. This triggers the Agent Runtime where you can process the email
5. Store the email in Storage for long-term retention

Each service is composed from lower-level primitives rather than built from scratch.

## Why This Matters

<span className="text-cyan-700 dark:text-cyan-500 font-semibold">Composability</span>: Higher-level services are built from lower-level primitives. Need a new capability? Combine existing primitives rather than building from scratch.

<span className="text-cyan-700 dark:text-cyan-500 font-semibold">Portability</span>: Because Layer 1 uses standard protocols, the underlying infrastructure can be swapped. Your workloads aren't locked into proprietary systems.

<span className="text-cyan-700 dark:text-cyan-500 font-semibold">Reliability</span>: Built on battle-tested primitives like Postgres and S3, not experimental infrastructure. Your agents run on foundations that have proven themselves at scale.

<span className="text-cyan-700 dark:text-cyan-500 font-semibold">Agentic</span>: Since you can peek behind the curtain and see what's happening across these abstractions, your agents can too. This creates better context and feedback loops, allowing your agents to build software quickly and effectively.
