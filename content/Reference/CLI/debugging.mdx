title: Debugging Deployments
description: SSH into containers, inspect sessions, and troubleshoot issues in your deployed agents.
---

Debug live deployments by SSHing into containers, transferring files, inspecting sessions and threads, and viewing deployment logs.

## SSH Access

Connect to your deployed containers for debugging:

```bash
# SSH into current project
agentuity cloud ssh

# SSH into specific project
agentuity cloud ssh proj_abc123xyz

# SSH into specific deployment
agentuity cloud ssh dep_abc123xyz

# SSH into a sandbox
agentuity cloud ssh sbx_abc123xyz

# Run a command and exit
agentuity cloud ssh 'ps aux'

# Run command on specific project
agentuity cloud ssh proj_abc123xyz 'tail -f /var/log/app.log'

# Show SSH command without executing
agentuity cloud ssh --show
```

<Callout type="warning" title="SSH Key Required">
Add your SSH public key before connecting:

```bash
agentuity auth ssh add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

See [Getting Started](/Reference/CLI/getting-started) for authentication setup.
</Callout>

**Interactive session:**
```bash
agentuity cloud ssh

# Now you're in the container
cd /app
ls -la
cat .env
exit
```

## File Transfer

Use SCP to upload and download files from deployments:

```bash
# Upload file to home directory
agentuity cloud scp upload ./config.json

# Upload to specific path
agentuity cloud scp upload ./config.json /app/config.json

# Upload to specific project
agentuity cloud scp upload ./config.json --identifier=proj_abc123xyz

# Upload multiple files
agentuity cloud scp upload ./logs/*.log ~/logs/

# Download file to current directory
agentuity cloud scp download /var/log/app.log

# Download to specific path
agentuity cloud scp download /var/log/app.log ./logs/

# Download from specific project
agentuity cloud scp download /app/config.json --identifier=proj_abc123xyz

# Download multiple files
agentuity cloud scp download ~/logs/*.log ./logs/
```

**Common use cases:**
- Upload configuration files for testing
- Download logs for local analysis
- Transfer debug scripts
- Backup application state

## Agent Inspection

List and inspect agents deployed in your project:

```bash
# List all agents in the project
agentuity cloud agent list

# List agents for a specific project
agentuity cloud agent list --project-id=proj_abc123xyz

# Get details for a specific agent
agentuity cloud agent get agent_abc123xyz

# View agent input/output schema
agentuity cloud agent schema agent_abc123xyz
```

**Agent details include:**
- Agent ID and name
- Description and metadata
- Associated routes
- Schema definitions (input/output types)

Use agent inspection to:
- Verify deployed agent configuration
- Debug schema mismatches
- Explore available agents in a project
- Generate client code from schemas

## Session Logs

Inspect individual agent sessions, including request details, timeline, and logs:

```bash
# List recent sessions
agentuity cloud session list

# List 25 most recent sessions
agentuity cloud session list --count=25

# Filter by project
agentuity cloud session list --project-id=proj_abc123xyz

# Filter by deployment
agentuity cloud session list --deployment-id=dep_abc123xyz

# Only successful sessions
agentuity cloud session list --success=true

# Only failed sessions
agentuity cloud session list --success=false

# Filter by specific trigger type
agentuity cloud session list --trigger=api

# Filter by specific environment
agentuity cloud session list --env=production
```

**Get session details:**
```bash
# Full session information with timeline
agentuity cloud session get sess_abc123xyz
```

This shows:
- Request method, URL, and headers
- Success/failure status and error messages
- Duration and timing information
- Agent execution timeline
- Eval runs (if configured)

**View session logs:**
```bash
# View logs for specific session
agentuity cloud session logs sess_abc123xyz

# Hide timestamps
agentuity cloud session logs sess_abc123xyz --no-timestamps
```

<Callout type="info" title="Session vs. Deployment Logs">
Session logs show output for a single request. Deployment logs show all output from a deployment, including startup, errors, and background tasks.
</Callout>

## Thread Inspection

List and manage conversation threads. For details on how threads work in agents, see [State Management](/Agents/state-management).

```bash
# List recent threads
agentuity cloud thread list

# List 25 most recent threads
agentuity cloud thread list --count=25

# Filter by project
agentuity cloud thread list --project-id=proj_abc123xyz

# Get thread details
agentuity cloud thread get thrd_abc123xyz

# Delete a thread
agentuity cloud thread delete thrd_abc123xyz
```

**Thread details include:**
- Thread ID and timestamps
- Associated project
- User data (metadata)
- Deletion status

Use thread inspection to:
- Debug conversation state issues
- Clean up old threads
- Verify thread metadata
- Track thread lifecycle

## Deployment Logs

Stream logs from a specific deployment:

```bash
# View deployment logs
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz

# Limit to 50 log entries
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz --limit=50

# Hide timestamps
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz --no-timestamps

# Specify project explicitly
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz --project-id=proj_abc123xyz
```

**Log output includes:**
- Severity levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Timestamps
- Log messages
- Stack traces for errors

**Use deployment logs to:**
- Monitor startup issues
- Debug background tasks
- Track errors across requests
- Analyze performance issues

## JSON Output for Scripting

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output. Combined with [jq](/Reference/CLI/getting-started#json-output), you can filter and transform results:

```bash
# Get session list as JSON
agentuity --json cloud session list --count=100 > sessions.json

# Get thread details as JSON
agentuity --json cloud thread get thrd_abc123xyz

# Process with jq
agentuity --json cloud session list | jq '.[] | select(.success == false)'

# Find failed sessions in last hour
agentuity --json cloud session list --count=100 | \
  jq '.[] | select(.success == false) | {id, url, error}'

# Count sessions by trigger type
agentuity --json cloud session list --count=100 | \
  jq 'group_by(.trigger) | map({trigger: .[0].trigger, count: length})'
```

**Scripting examples:**

Here are some practical scripts for monitoring and automation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Monitor for failures and send alerts

FAILED=$(agentuity --json cloud session list --success=false --count=10)
COUNT=$(echo "$FAILED" | jq 'length')

if [ "$COUNT" -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "Alert: $COUNT failed sessions detected"
  echo "$FAILED" | jq '.[] | {id, url, error}'
fi
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Export thread user data

agentuity --json cloud thread list --count=100 | \
  jq -r '.[] | [.id, .user_data] | @csv' > threads.csv
```
