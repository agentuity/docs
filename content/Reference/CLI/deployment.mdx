title: Deploying to the Cloud
description: Deploy your agents to Agentuity Cloud with automatic infrastructure provisioning.
---

Deploy your Agentuity project to the cloud with a single command. The platform handles infrastructure, scaling, and monitoring automatically.

## Deploy Your Project

```bash
agentuity deploy
# or
bun run deploy
```

The deploy command:
1. Syncs environment variables from `.env.production` (or `.env` as fallback)
2. Builds and packages your project
3. Encrypts and uploads the deployment bundle securely
4. Provisions your deployment on Agentuity's infrastructure
5. Activates your deployment

After deployment, view your environment variables and secrets in the [Agentuity App](https://app-v1.agentuity.com) under **Project > Settings**.

**Example output:**

```
✓ Sync Env & Secrets
✓ Create Deployment
✓ Build, Verify and Package
✓ Encrypt and Upload Deployment
✓ Provision Deployment

Your project was deployed!

→ Deployment ID:  dep_abc123xyz
→ Deployment URL: https://dep-abc123xyz.agentuity.cloud
→ Project URL:    https://proj-456def.agentuity.cloud
→ Dashboard:      https://app-v1.agentuity.com/deployments/dep_abc123xyz
```

The Dashboard URL links directly to the deployment details in the Agentuity App.

## Deployment URLs

Each deployment gets two URLs:

**Deployment URL** (`dep_xxx.agentuity.cloud`):
- Unique URL for this specific deployment
- Persists even after new deployments
- Use for testing a specific version

**Project URL** (`proj_xxx.agentuity.cloud`):
- Always points to the active deployment
- Updates automatically when you deploy
- Use for stable endpoints and webhooks

```bash
# Deploy creates both URLs
agentuity deploy

# Deployment URL: https://dep-abc123.agentuity.cloud
# Project URL:    https://proj-456def.agentuity.cloud
```

Both URLs are automatically provisioned with HTTPS. The project URL always routes to the active deployment.

## Tagging Deployments

Add tags to label deployments:

```bash
# Single tag
agentuity deploy --tag staging

# Multiple tags
agentuity deploy --tag staging --tag hotfix-123
```

Tags appear in deployment lists and help organize versions:

```bash
agentuity cloud deployment list
# Shows tags column for each deployment
```

## Viewing Deployments

List recent deployments:

```bash
# Show 10 most recent
agentuity cloud deployment list

# Custom count
agentuity cloud deployment list --count=25

# For a specific project
agentuity cloud deployment list --project-id=proj_abc123xyz
```

**Example output:**

| ID | State | Active | Created | Message | Tags |
|----|-------|--------|---------|---------|------|
| dep_abc123 | completed | Yes | 12/1/25, 3:45 PM | | staging |
| dep_def456 | completed | | 12/1/25, 2:30 PM | | v1.2.0 |
| dep_ghi789 | completed | | 11/30/25, 5:00 PM | | |

## Deployment Details

View detailed information about a deployment:

```bash
# Show deployment details
agentuity cloud deployment show dep_abc123xyz

# For specific project
agentuity cloud deployment show dep_abc123xyz --project-id=proj_abc123
```

**Output includes:**
- Deployment ID, state, and creation time
- Active status
- Tags and custom domains
- Cloud region
- DNS records (for custom domain configuration)
- Git metadata (repo, commit, branch, PR)
- Build information (SDK version, runtime, platform)

```

```

<Callout type="tip" title="DNS Records">
When custom domains are configured, the `show` command displays the required DNS records. Use this to verify your CNAME configuration.
</Callout>

## Viewing Logs

Fetch logs for a deployment:

```bash
# View logs
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz

# Limit log entries
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz --limit=50

# Hide timestamps
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz --no-timestamps

# For specific project
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz --project-id=proj_abc123
```

Logs show severity (INFO, WARN, ERROR) and message body with color-coded output.

<Callout type="info" title="Real-Time Logs">
For live streaming logs, use SSH access. See [Debugging](/Reference/CLI/debugging) for SSH setup.
</Callout>

## Rolling Back

Revert to a previous deployment:

```bash
agentuity cloud deployment rollback
```

The command:
1. Finds the previous completed deployment
2. Prompts for confirmation
3. Activates the previous deployment
4. Updates the project URL

```
Rollback to deployment dep_def456? (y/N): y
✓ Rolled back to deployment dep_def456
```

Use for specific projects:

```bash
agentuity cloud deployment rollback --project-id=proj_abc123xyz
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Rollback Behavior">
Rollback activates the most recent completed deployment before the current one. The current deployment remains available at its deployment URL but is no longer active.
</Callout>

## Undeploying

Stop the active deployment:

```bash
# With confirmation prompt
agentuity cloud deployment undeploy

# Skip confirmation
agentuity cloud deployment undeploy --force

# For specific project
agentuity cloud deployment undeploy --project-id=proj_abc123xyz
```

After undeploying:
- The project URL becomes unavailable
- All deployment-specific URLs remain accessible
- Previous deployments are not deleted
- You can redeploy or rollback at any time

<Callout type="warning" title="Undeploy Impact">
Undeploying stops the active deployment immediately. Your project URL will return 404 until you deploy or rollback.
</Callout>

## Removing Deployments

Permanently delete a deployment:

```bash
# Remove a specific deployment
agentuity cloud deployment remove dep_abc123xyz

# For specific project
agentuity cloud deployment remove dep_abc123xyz --project-id=proj_abc123xyz
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Permanent Deletion">
Removing a deployment permanently deletes it. You cannot rollback to a removed deployment.
</Callout>

## Custom Domains

Configure custom domains in `agentuity.json`:

```json
{
  "projectId": "proj_abc123xyz",
  "orgId": "org_def456",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "deployment": {
    "domains": ["api.example.com", "app.example.com"]
  }
}
```

Available regions are fetched from the API at deployment time. If multiple regions are available, the CLI prompts you to select one.

### DNS Configuration

Add a CNAME record for each custom domain. A CNAME record tells DNS to resolve your domain to Agentuity's servers:

```
Type:  CNAME
Name:  api.example.com
Value: p<hash>.agentuity.cloud
TTL:   600
```

The `p<hash>` value is your project's unique identifier, shown when you run `agentuity deploy` or in the App.

The CLI validates DNS records during deployment:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```

```
✓ Validate Custom Domains: api.example.com, app.example.com
✓ Sync Env & Secrets
...
```

<Callout type="warning" title="DNS Validation">
Deployment fails if DNS records are missing or incorrect. The CLI shows the required CNAME value in the error message.
</Callout>

### Multiple Domains

Custom domains replace the default URLs:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "domains": ["api.example.com"]
  }
}
```

After deployment with custom domains, the CLI only shows custom URLs:

```
→ Deployment ID:  dep_abc123xyz
→ Deployment URL: https://api.example.com
```

The project URL and deployment-specific URLs still exist but custom domains take precedence in the output.

## Resource Configuration

Configure CPU, memory, and disk limits in `agentuity.json`:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "resources": {
      "cpu": "500m",
      "memory": "512Mi",
      "disk": "1Gi"
    },
    "domains": []
  }
}
```

**Defaults:** `cpu: "500m"`, `memory: "500Mi"`, `disk: "500Mi"`. Increase as needed for your workload.

The `domains` array is empty by default. Add custom domains when needed (see [Custom Domains](#custom-domains)).

## Environment Variables

The deploy command syncs variables from `.env.production` (or `.env` as fallback):

```bash
# .env.production
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
WEBHOOK_SECRET=secret123
MY_CUSTOM_API_KEY=xxx
```

<Callout type="info" title="AI Provider Keys">
If you're using the [AI Gateway](/Agents/ai-gateway), you don't need to include provider API keys (like `OPENAI_API_KEY`). The gateway handles authentication automatically. Only include provider keys if you're bypassing the gateway.
</Callout>

Variables are automatically:
- Filtered (removes `AGENTUITY_` prefixed keys)
- Categorized (regular env vs secrets based on naming)
- Encrypted (secrets only)
- Synced to cloud before the build step

<Callout type="info" title="Secrets Detection">
Variables with suffixes like `_SECRET`, `_KEY`, `_TOKEN`, `_PASSWORD`, or `_PRIVATE` are automatically encrypted as secrets. All other variables are stored as regular environment variables.
</Callout>

## Deploy Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--tag <name>` | Add deployment tag (repeatable) |
| `-f, --force` | Force deployment without confirmation |
| `--dry-run` | Simulate deployment without executing |
| `--log-level debug` | Show verbose output |
| `--project-id <id>` | Deploy specific project |

```bash
# Verbose deployment
agentuity deploy --log-level=debug

# Multiple tags
agentuity deploy --tag staging --tag v1.2.0

# Specific project
agentuity deploy --project-id=proj_abc123xyz

# Simulate deployment
agentuity deploy --dry-run

# Force deployment
agentuity deploy --force
```

## CI/CD Pipelines

For automated deployments in CI/CD systems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.), you can use a pre-created deployment.

### Using Pre-Created Deployments

Set the `AGENTUITY_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable with deployment details:

```bash
export AGENTUITY_DEPLOYMENT='{"id":"dep_xxx","orgId":"org_xxx","publicKey":"..."}'
agentuity deploy
```

The JSON object requires:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | The deployment ID |
| `orgId` | Your organization ID |
| `publicKey` | The deployment's public key |

When this variable is set, the CLI:
- Skips deployment creation and uses the existing deployment
- Uses plain output mode (no TUI) for cleaner CI logs
- Validates the JSON schema before proceeding

<Callout type="info" title="Getting Deployment Details">
Pre-created deployments are typically provisioned by external systems like GitHub Actions workflows or custom CI pipelines that integrate with the Agentuity API.
</Callout>
