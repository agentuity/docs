description: Run the development server with hot reload, local mode, and the interactive Workbench.
---

Run your Agentuity project locally with automatic hot reload, type checking, and the interactive Workbench UI.

## Starting the Dev Server

```bash
agentuity dev
# or
bun run dev
```

The server starts on port 3500 by default with:
- Hot reload on file changes
- TypeScript type checking
- Public URL tunneling (optional, for webhooks and sharing)
- Interactive keyboard shortcuts

## Dev Server Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--port` | 3500 (or `PORT` env) | TCP port for the dev server |
| `--local` | false | Use local services instead of cloud |
| `--no-public` | - | Disable public URL tunneling |
| `--no-interactive` | - | Disable interactive keyboard shortcuts |
| `--inspect` | - | Enable Bun debugger for debugging |
| `--inspect-wait` | - | Enable debugger and wait for connection before starting |
| `--inspect-brk` | - | Enable debugger and break on first line |

<Callout type="tip" title="PORT Environment Variable">
The dev server respects the `PORT` environment variable. The `--port` flag takes precedence if both are set.
</Callout>

```bash
# Custom port
agentuity dev --port 8080

# Local mode (offline development)
agentuity dev --local

# Disable public URL
agentuity dev --no-public

# Non-interactive mode (useful for CI/CD)
agentuity dev --no-interactive
```

## Debugging with Inspector

Use the inspector flags to debug your agents with Chrome DevTools or VS Code:

```bash
# Enable inspector (attach debugger anytime)
agentuity dev --inspect

# Wait for debugger before starting the server
agentuity dev --inspect-wait

# Break on first line of executed code
agentuity dev --inspect-brk
```

Bun dynamically selects an available port and prints it to the console. Check the output for the debugger URL and port number.

After starting, open `chrome://inspect` in Chrome or use VS Code's debugger to attach.

<Callout type="tip" title="VS Code Debugging">
Create a launch configuration that attaches to the running process. Update the port to match the one shown in the console output:

```json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "attach",
  "name": "Attach to Agentuity",
  "port": 6499
}
```
</Callout>

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Press keys during development to control the server:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` | Show help |
| `c` | Clear console |
| `r` | Restart server |
| `o` | Show routes |
| `a` | Show agents |
| `q` | Quit |

## Local Mode

Use `--local` to develop offline without cloud services:

```bash
agentuity dev --local
```

<Callout type="info" title="When to Use Local Mode">
Local mode disables cloud services (KV, Vector, Object Storage). Use when developing without internet or testing with mock data.
</Callout>

**What happens in local mode:**
- No connection to Agentuity cloud
- Storage APIs disabled unless you provide [custom implementations](/Services/Storage/custom)
- Public URL tunneling disabled
- Requires your own API keys for AI providers (in `.env`), since the [AI Gateway](/Agents/ai-gateway) is not available

**Bring Your Own Storage:**

```typescript
// app.ts
import { createApp } from '@agentuity/runtime';
import { MyCustomKV } from './storage';

const app = createApp({
  services: {
    useLocal: true,
    keyvalue: new MyCustomKV(), // Your implementation
  },
});
```

See [Custom Storage](/Services/Storage/custom) for implementation details.

## Public URLs

Public URLs are enabled by default to share your local dev server or receive webhooks:

```bash
# Public URL enabled by default
agentuity dev

# Disable if not needed
agentuity dev --no-public
```

### Why Public URLs?

Testing webhooks and external integrations during local development is painful. You either deploy constantly, configure port forwarding, or pay for third-party tunneling services. Each option adds friction to the development loop.

Agentuity's Gravity network handles this automatically. When you run `agentuity dev`, your local server gets a public HTTPS URL instantly. No configuration, no separate tools, no accounts to manage. External services can reach your local agents as if they were already deployed.

**This means:**

- **Instant HTTPS URLs**: Automatic certificate generation
- **Zero setup**: Works out of the box, no firewall rules or port forwarding
- **Secure tunneling**: Encrypted connections through Agentuity's edge network
- **Automatic reconnection**: Handles network interruptions gracefully

**Example output:**
```
⨺ Agentuity DevMode
  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:3500
  Public:  https://abc123.devmode.agentuity.com

  Press h for keyboard shortcuts
```

**Example use cases:**
- Testing Slack, Discord, or Twilio webhooks
- Sharing with team members
- Testing from mobile devices
- OAuth callback URLs

## Workbench UI

Access the interactive Workbench at `http://localhost:3500/workbench` to test agents visually. It displays agent schemas, handles input validation, and shows execution results with timing metrics.

See [Testing with Workbench](/Agents/workbench) for setup and configuration.

## Building Your Project

Bundle your project for deployment:

```bash
agentuity build
```

**What happens during build:**
1. TypeScript compilation
2. Bundle agents, routes, and frontend
3. Generate registry and types
4. Type check with `tsc`
5. Create `.agentuity/` output directory

### Build Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--dev` | false | Enable development mode |
| `--outdir` | `.agentuity` | Output directory |
| `--skip-type-check` | false | Skip TypeScript type checking |

```bash
# Skip type checking (faster builds)
agentuity build --skip-type-check

# Custom output directory
agentuity build --outdir ./dist
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Type Check Failures">
Build fails if TypeScript errors are detected. Fix type errors or use `--skip-type-check` to override (not recommended for deployments).
</Callout>

## Hot Reload Behavior

The dev server watches for file changes and automatically:
- Rebuilds on source file changes (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`)
- Runs TypeScript type checking
- Restarts the server
- Preserves background tasks

**Ignored files:**
- `node_modules/`
- `.agentuity/` (build output)
- Generated files (`*.generated.ts`)
- Temporary files

**Cooldown period:** 500ms after build completes to prevent restart loops.

## Dev Server Architecture

The dev server uses Vite for frontend hot module replacement (HMR) and Bun for server-side code. All requests go through a single port (3500), so you don't need to manage multiple servers or ports during development.

- **Frontend changes** (React, CSS) reload instantly via Vite HMR
- **Server changes** (agents, routes) trigger a fast Bun rebuild
- **WebSocket connections** work seamlessly

## Development vs Production

Understanding the differences between local development and deployed production:

| Aspect | Local (`agentuity dev`) | Production (`agentuity deploy`) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Storage** | Cloud services (or local with `--local`) | Cloud services always |
| **AI Gateway** | Available (or BYO keys with `--local`) | Available always |
| **URL** | `localhost:3500` + optional public tunnel | `*.agentuity.cloud` or custom domain |
| **Hot Reload** | Yes | No (redeploy required) |
| **Debugging** | Local logs, Workbench | SSH access, cloud logs |
| **Environment** | `.env` | `.env.production` (synced to cloud) |
