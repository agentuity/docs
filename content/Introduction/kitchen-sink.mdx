## Overview

New to Agentuity? The Kitchen Sink is the fastest way to see what's possible on the platform.

## Interactive Learning

Deploy 20+ working agents that demonstrate every SDK feature. Send messages, watch responses, and copy the patterns that work.

**Why start here:**
- See features in action before reading documentation
- Test patterns in a live environment
- Learn by doing with working code examples

## How It Works

1. **Deploy instantly** - One-click deployment to your Agentuity account
2. **Open DevMode** - Interactive testing environment in your browser
3. **Send messages** - Talk to each agent to see features in action
4. **Read the code** - Source code is available for every example
5. **Copy patterns** - Use working implementations in your projects

## Quick Start

Once deployed, you'll have access to DevMode where you can:

- **Ask the `kitchen-sink` agent** questions about any platform feature
- **Try suggested prompts** from each agent to see capabilities
- **Watch logs in real-time** to understand execution flow
- **View responses** to see how each agent behaves

<Callout type="info">
Keep the GitHub repository open alongside DevMode to follow along with the source code as you test each feature.
