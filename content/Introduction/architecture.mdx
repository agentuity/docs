## System Architecture

Agentuity is a cloud platform designed to run and scale AI agents with enterprise-grade reliability. 
Our architecture follows a container-based approach, where each agent operates in its own specialized 
environment.

Unlike traditional serverless platforms, Agentuity ensures containers run for as long as agents need, 
maintaining state and context throughout agent lifecycles. This long-running container approach is 
optimal for complex AI workloads that may require extended processing time.

The platform is fundamentally cross-platform, allowing you to run different agent frameworks 
(CrewAI, Langchain, custom agents) side by side in the same ecosystem, with built-in communication 
channels between them.

## Core Components

Agentuity consists of four primary components:

1. **Container Runtime** - The execution environment where your agents run, providing:
   - Isolated, secure container environments for each agent
   - Automatic scaling based on workload
   - Resource management and optimization
   - Long-running container support for persistent agents

2. **Command Line Interface (CLI)** - A developer tool that enables:
   - Quick agent creation and initialization
   - Local development and testing
   - Deployment management to the Agentuity cloud
   - Agent monitoring and troubleshooting

3. **Software Development Kits (SDKs)** - Libraries that provide:
   - Agent-native tools and services
   - Runtime-specific optimizations for Python and JavaScript (Node and Bun)
   - Integration capabilities with external systems
   - Enhanced agent capabilities and extensions

4. **Web Console** - A management interface offering:
   - Real-time agent monitoring and metrics
   - Deployment and configuration management
   - Usage analytics and performance insights
   - Team collaboration features

## Data Flow

Agent communication and data flow in Agentuity follow secure, encrypted channels:

1. **Agent-to-Agent Communication** - Agents can communicate with each other through encrypted routing, 
regardless of the underlying frameworks used.

2. **External Integrations** - Agents can connect to external systems and data sources through managed 
integration points.

3. **Deployment Pipeline** - Your project code is packaged, containerized, and deployed to the Agentuity 
cloud infrastructure with appropriate networking and routing configured automatically.

## Scalability

Agentuity is designed for enterprise-scale agent deployments:

- **Horizontal Scaling** - Automatically provision additional resources as demand increases
- **Framework Agnostic** - Scale any type of agent regardless of the underlying framework
- **Load Balancing** - Distribute agent workloads efficiently across available resources
- **Resource Optimization** - Intelligently allocate compute resources based on agent requirements

## Security Architecture

Security is foundational to Agentuity's design:

- **Container Isolation** - Each agent operates in its own isolated environment
- **Encrypted Communications** - All agent-to-agent communication is encrypted
- **Secure Deployment** - Protected deployment pipeline from development to production
