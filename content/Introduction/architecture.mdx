## System Architecture

Agentuity is a cloud platform designed to run and scale AI agents with enterprise-grade reliability. 
Our architecture follows a container-based approach, where each agent operates in its own specialized 
environment.

Unlike traditional serverless platforms, Agentuity ensures containers run for as long as agents need, 
maintaining state and context throughout agent lifecycles. This long-running container approach is 
optimal for complex AI workloads that may require extended processing time.

The platform is fundamentally cross-platform, allowing you to run different agent frameworks 
(CrewAI, Langchain, custom agents) side by side in the same ecosystem, with built-in communication 
channels between them.

## Core Components

Agentuity consists of four primary components:

1. **Container Runtime** - The execution environment where your agents run, providing:
   - Isolated, secure container environments for each agent
   - Automatic scaling based on workload
   - Resource management and optimization
   - Long-running container support for persistent agents

2. **Command Line Interface (CLI)** - A developer tool that enables:
   - Quick agent creation and initialization
   - Local development and testing
   - Deployment management to the Agentuity cloud
   - Agent monitoring and troubleshooting

3. **Software Development Kits (SDKs)** - Libraries that provide:
   - Agent-native tools and services
   - Runtime-specific optimizations for Python and JavaScript (Node and Bun)
   - Integration capabilities with external systems
   - Enhanced agent capabilities and extensions

4. **Web Console** - A management interface offering:
   - Real-time agent monitoring and metrics
   - Deployment and configuration management
   - Usage analytics and performance insights
   - Team collaboration features

## Data Flow

Agent communication and data flow in Agentuity follow secure, encrypted channels:

1. **Agent-to-Agent Communication** - Agents can communicate with each other through encrypted routing, 
regardless of the underlying frameworks used.

2. **External Integrations** - Agents can connect to external systems and data sources through managed 
integration points.

3. **Deployment Pipeline** - Your project code is packaged, containerized, and deployed to the Agentuity 
cloud infrastructure with appropriate networking and routing configured automatically.

## Scalability

Agentuity is designed for enterprise-scale agent deployments:

- **Horizontal Scaling** - Automatically provision additional resources as demand increases
- **Framework Agnostic** - Scale any type of agent regardless of the underlying framework
- **Load Balancing** - Distribute agent workloads efficiently across available resources
- **Resource Optimization** - Intelligently allocate compute resources based on agent requirements

## Security Architecture

Security is foundational to Agentuity's design:

- **Container Isolation** - Each agent operates in its own isolated environment
- **Encrypted Communications** - All agent-to-agent communication is encrypted
- **Secure Deployment** - Protected deployment pipeline from development to production

## Project Conventions

Agentuity projects follow specific conventions in order to take advantage of the deployment and cloud platform Agentuity offers. While we don't dictate which framework to use, we do have a few things you have to follow in your file system. Understanding these conventions are important.

### Project Structure

Every Agentuity project requires the following core components:

1. **agentuity.yaml** - The central configuration file that defines:
   - Project metadata (name, ID, description)
   - Development settings (port, watch patterns)
   - Deployment configuration (resources, scaling)
   - Bundler settings (language, runtime)
   - Agent definitions and routing

2. **Environment Variables** - Stored in a `.env` file:
   - `AGENTUITY_SDK_KEY` - Authenticates SDK requests to the platform
   - `AGENTUITY_PROJECT_KEY` - Identifies your project to the platform
   - Additional provider-specific keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

3. **Agent Directory** - Specified in `bundler.agents.dir` (typically `src/agents`):
   - Each agent has its own subdirectory
   - Language-specific entry points (index.ts/js for JavaScript, agent.py for Python)
   - Agent-specific configuration and dependencies

### Language-Specific Conventions

#### JavaScript/TypeScript Projects

```
my-project/
├── agentuity.yaml        # Project configuration
├── .env                  # Environment variables
├── package.json          # Dependencies and scripts
└── src/
    └── agents/           # Agent directory (configurable)
        └── my-agent/     # Individual agent
            └── index.ts  # Agent entry point
```

- Each agent must export a handler function that processes requests
- TypeScript is recommended but JavaScript is fully supported
- Supported runtimes: Node.js and Bun

#### Python Projects

```
my-project/
├── agentuity.yaml        # Project configuration
├── .env                  # Environment variables
├── pyproject.toml        # Dependencies and configuration
└── src/
    └── agents/           # Agent directory (configurable)
        └── my-agent/     # Individual agent
            └── agent.py  # Agent entry point
```

- Each agent must define a `run()` function that processes requests
- Supported runtimes: Python and uv (for dependency management)

### Configuration File (agentuity.yaml)

The `agentuity.yaml` file is the heart of your project, defining how it behaves in development and production:

```yaml
version: ">=0.0.0"         # Minimum CLI version required
project_id: "proj_..."     # Unique project identifier
name: "My Project"         # Human-readable project name
description: "..."         # Optional project description

# Development configuration
development:
  port: 3000               # Local development server port
  watch:
    enabled: true          # Auto-reload on file changes
    files: ["src/**/*.ts"] # Files to watch

# Deployment configuration
deployment:
  resources:
    memory: "1Gi"          # Memory allocation
    cpu: "1000m"           # CPU allocation

# Bundler configuration
bundler:
  language: "javascript"   # Programming language (javascript or python)
  runtime: "nodejs"        # Runtime environment (nodejs, bunjs, python, uv)
  agents:
    dir: "src/agents"      # Directory where agents are located

# Agents configuration
agents:
  - id: "agent_..."        # Unique agent identifier
    name: "My Agent"       # Human-readable agent name
    description: "..."     # Optional agent description
```

### Why These Conventions Matter

These conventions enable several key capabilities:

1. **Consistent Development Experience** - Standardized structure makes it easier to work across projects
2. **Automated Deployment** - The CLI can package and deploy your project without additional configuration
3. **Framework Flexibility** - Use any agent framework while maintaining compatibility with the platform

### Importing Existing Projects

If you have an existing agent project, you can adapt it to Agentuity by:

1. Creating an `agentuity.yaml` file with your project configuration
2. Organizing your agents according to the conventions above
3. Running `agentuity project import` to register with the platform
