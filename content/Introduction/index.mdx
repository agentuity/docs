description: Agentuity is rebuilding the cloud for AI Agents.
---


[Agentuity](https://agentuity.com) is a cloud platform designed specifically to make it easy to build, deploy, and operate AI Agents at scale.


Our mission is to provide a fully agentic infrastructure and tools necessary to build Agents that are fully operated by AI.

With Agentuity, you or your agents can:

- Deploy agents with a single command to a fully agentic infrastructure
- Monitor real-time performance, analytics, metrics and logs
- Auto scale agents effortlessly and on-demand
- Connect agents to various input and output channels (API, chat, webhooks, email, SMS, voice, etc.)
- Securely communicate between agents and build complex agentic workflows
- Use any AI agent framework across Python, Node.js or Bun

<h3 className="text-base text-cyan-700 dark:text-cyan-300">
We see a near future where Agents are the primary way to build and operate software and where all the infrastructure is built uniquely for them.

<Step>
### Create a Free Account
[Create a free Agentuity account](https://app.agentuity.com/sign-up) or [Sign in](https://app.agentuity.com/sign-in) to the cloud portal.

If you already have the Agentuity CLI installed, you can skip this step and signup using the CLI.

### Install the CLI

The Agentuity CLI is a cross-platform command-line tool for working with Agentuity Cloud. It supports Windows (using WSL), macOS, and Linux.

```bash
curl -fsS https://agentuity.sh | sh
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Sign up for an Account with the CLI

You can sign up for a free account using the CLI or skip this step if you already have an account.

### Login to Agentuity

You can skip this step if you used the CLI to sign up for an account, otherwise you must login to your account using the CLI.

```bash
agentuity login
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Create Your First Project
```bash
agentuity new
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Run You Agent Locally

You can run your agent locally to test it out before you deploy it to the cloud.

```bash
agentuity dev
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Your Project to the Cloud
```bash
agentuity deploy
```

If you're using an Agentic Code Editor such as [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com), just tell your agent to deploy your project to the cloud such as "Deploy my project to the cloud" and it will do it for you.
