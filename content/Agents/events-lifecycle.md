# Events & Lifecycle

Agentuity provides agent-level events and app-level events, with a bunch of different lifecycles that come about. It's nice because depending on what goes on, you can hook into that and do all sorts of things.

## Two Levels of Events

At a granular level, you can handle an agent or handle a route. Then you start getting broader and broader and can listen to the whole system and see how things are going.

Agent-level events let you track individual agent execution, while app-level events let you monitor all agents globally across your entire application.

## Flexible Event Handling

The event system provides flexibility from fine-grained to system-wide event handling. You can implement targeted logging for specific agents while also maintaining global observability across your application.
