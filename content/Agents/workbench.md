# Workbench

Once you're ready to test and see how your agent works, Workbench is a really useful tool. Workbench is a simulator that you can use when running agents locally on your desktop—or even when testing deployed agents.

## How It Works

Workbench opens up as a chat interface where you can invoke your agent. What's cool is the UI knows the inputs that the agent expects, so it'll automatically fill all that stuff out for you. If your agent expects a message as a string, Workbench will set up the "message" field automatically.

You can either have it automatically generate a message or type one out yourself. Whether the input is a simple string, a JSON object, or whatever, Workbench helps you structure it correctly. This makes testing out agents really easy.

## Testing Production Agents

Once your agents are deployed, you can still use the same agent simulator to play around with your production agent. You can deploy an agent and then use the same Workbench interface to interact with the deployed version, which is really great for verifying that everything works as expected in the live environment.
