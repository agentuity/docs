# Standalone Execution

Because of the way the agent part of things is built, you can easily invoke an agent in any other part of your code. It just feels like JavaScript—even though when you look at it there's the schema, there's the handler, and then all the cloud stuff around it with routing and access to cloud services.

## Simple Invocation

Even though Agentuity does all that infrastructure work, using an agent is literally just: import your module or agent, and then run it. It feels like a normal JavaScript function.

Back to developer and agent experience—it makes it really easy to use and integrate into your existing codebase without ceremony or boilerplate.
