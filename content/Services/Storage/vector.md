# Vector Storage

Vector storage is a simplified, easy service for semantic search and embeddings. It's based on top of PG Vector at the end of the day.

## What It's Great For

Vector storage is great for semantic search, embeddings, and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). You can find information by meaning rather than exact keyword matches, and build knowledge bases that provide relevant context to LLMs for more accurate, grounded responses.

## Consistent Access Philosophy

Same philosophy as other storage—agents can access and use it as a tool, as can developers coding by hand. It's easily accessible from routes and agents through the context.
