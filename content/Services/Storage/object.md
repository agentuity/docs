# Object Storage

Agentuity offers S3-compatible storage using Tigris under the hood.

## Native Bun Integration

Since Agentuity is first-class Bun, they just use the S3 module from Bun. There are no extra modules or heavy binaries to import—it just works with Bun out of the box.

## Available to Everyone

Same philosophy—object storage is available for agents and developers to use. Whether you're building autonomous agents that need to store files or creating developer tools that manage documents, the same simple API applies.
