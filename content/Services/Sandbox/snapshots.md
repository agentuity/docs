# Sandbox Snapshots

You can do some neat things with sandboxes. You can build up your sandbox—add a bunch of files to it, set it up—and then you can create a snapshot. Now you can create sandboxes from that snapshot.

## Personalized Sandboxes

This lets you personalize your sandboxes and then always invoke those when you want to. Configure your sandbox environment once with the exact tools, files, and dependencies you need, and every sandbox created from that snapshot starts in the same known state.

## Benefits

It's a pretty powerful capability for customized, reusable sandbox environments. You skip dependency installation and configuration on each run since everything is pre-installed in the snapshot. Some examples include pre-configured language environments with common packages installed, project-specific setups with all dependencies ready to go, and standardized development environments that team members can use consistently.
