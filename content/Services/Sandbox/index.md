# Sandboxes

Sandboxes are small containers. They're meant to be ephemeral—they can stick around if you want, but they're little execution environments that pop up where your agent or route can execute code in or write code in.

## How Sandboxes Work

You can send code to a sandbox, write it or run it, and get the output back out. That's what sandboxes are for. There's an SDK where you can invoke it, reach for the sandbox, stuff the code in there really quick, run it, get the output, and you're good to go.

## Use Cases

There are a lot of really cool use cases. If you give a sandbox to an agent as a tool, the agent knows "I'm building this thing, I need to run this" and can reach for the sandbox. Another example: you can have a coding agent in the sandbox that pulls down a GitHub repo, does a bunch of stuff, and then sends it back out.

There are tons of examples for sandbox use cases—code execution, build pipelines, testing, and more. Sandboxes open up lots of really cool possibilities for agents that need to interact with code dynamically.
