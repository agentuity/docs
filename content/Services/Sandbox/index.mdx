title: Running Code in Sandboxes
description: Run code in isolated, secure containers with configurable resources
---

Execute code in isolated Linux containers with configurable resource limits, network controls, and execution timeouts.

## Why Sandboxes?

Agents that reason about code need somewhere safe to execute it. Whether generating Python scripts, validating builds, or running user-provided code, you can't let arbitrary execution happen on your infrastructure.

The pattern keeps repeating: spin up a secure environment, run code, tear it down. Without proper isolation, a single bad script could access sensitive data, exhaust resources, or compromise your systems.

Agentuity sandboxes handle this automatically. Every execution runs in an isolated container with its own filesystem, configurable resource limits, and network controls. When execution completes, the environment is destroyed.

**What this gives you:**

- **Security by default**: Network disabled, filesystem isolated, resource limits enforced
- **No infrastructure management**: Containers spin up and tear down automatically
- **Multi-language support**: Run Python, Node.js, shell scripts, and more
- **Consistent environments**: Use snapshots to get the same setup every time, with dependencies pre-installed

## Three Ways to Use Sandboxes

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **[Web App](https://app-v1.agentuity.com)** | Visual management, browsing runtimes and snapshots |
| **[SDK](/Services/Sandbox/sdk-usage)** | Programmatic use in agents and routes (`ctx.sandbox`) |
| **[CLI](/Reference/CLI/sandbox)** | Local development, scripting, CI/CD |

<Callout type="info" title="Multi-language Execution">
Your agents are written in TypeScript, but the sandbox can run any language safely. Use `ctx.sandbox.run()` to execute Python, Node.js, shell scripts, or anything available via `apt install` in isolated containers.
</Callout>

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Runtime** | A pre-configured base environment (OS + language tools) provided by Agentuity |
| **Sandbox** | A running container created from a runtime where you execute commands |
| **Snapshot** | A saved sandbox state that can be used to create new sandboxes |

These build on each other: **Runtime → Sandbox → Snapshot**. Here's an example of how to use all three:

1. Pick a **runtime** (e.g., `bun:1` or `node:latest`)
2. Create a **sandbox** from that runtime
3. Optionally save a **snapshot** to reuse your configured environment

## Runtimes

Runtimes are pre-configured base environments that Agentuity provides. Each includes an operating system, language toolchain, and common utilities.

### Language Runtimes

Use these for general code execution:

| Runtime | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `base:latest` | Minimal Debian runtime with essential tools  (default) |
| `bun:1` | Bun 1.x with JavaScript/TypeScript support |
| `node:latest` | Node.js latest version |
| `node:lts` | Node.js LTS version |
| `python:3.13` | Python 3.13 |
| `python:3.14` | Python 3.14 |
| `golang:latest` | Golang latest |

### Agent Runtimes

Pre-configured AI coding assistants:

| Runtime | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `claude-code:latest` | Claude Code AI assistant |
| `amp:latest` | Amp AI coding assistant |
| `codex:latest` | OpenAI Codex CLI agent |
| `gemini-cli:latest` | Google Gemini CLI agent |
| `opencode:latest` | OpenCode AI coding assistant |
| `agentuity:latest` | Agentuity CLI for building and running AI agents |

### Testing Runtimes

Pre-configured testing runtimes:

| Runtime | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `agent-browser:latest` | Headless browser automation CLI for AI agents |
| `playwright:v1` | Playwright browser automation runtime (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit) |

<Callout type="tip" title="List Available Runtimes">
Run `agentuity cloud sandbox runtime list` to see all available runtimes, or view them in the [Agentuity App](https://app-v1.agentuity.com) under **Services > Sandbox > Runtimes**.
</Callout>

### Runtime Metadata

Each runtime includes metadata for identification and resource planning:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `description` | What the runtime provides |
| `icon` | URL to runtime icon |
| `brandColor` | Hex color for UI display |
| `documentationUrl` | Link to runtime documentation |
| `tags` | Categories like `language`, `ai-agent` |
| `requirements` | Minimum memory, CPU, disk, and network needs |

View runtime details with `agentuity cloud sandbox runtime list --json`.

## Snapshots

A snapshot captures the filesystem state of a sandbox. You create new sandboxes *from* a snapshot rather than running it directly.

Snapshots build on top of runtimes. When you create a snapshot, it includes everything from the base runtime plus your installed dependencies and files.

**Workflow:**
1. Create a sandbox from a runtime
2. Install dependencies and configure the environment
3. Save a snapshot
4. Create new sandboxes from that snapshot (fast, no reinstallation needed)

See [Creating and Using Snapshots](/Services/Sandbox/snapshots) for details.

## Two Execution Modes

Choose based on your use case:

### One-shot (`sandbox.run()`)

Creates a sandbox, runs a single command, then destroys the sandbox. Best for stateless code execution.

```typescript
import { createAgent } from '@agentuity/runtime';

const agent = createAgent('CodeRunner', {
  handler: async (ctx, input) => {
    const result = await ctx.sandbox.run({
      command: { exec: ['python3', '-c', 'print("Hello!")'] },
      resources: { memory: '256Mi', cpu: '500m' },
    });

    ctx.logger.info('Output', { stdout: result.stdout, exitCode: result.exitCode });
    return { output: result.stdout, exitCode: result.exitCode };
  },
});
```

### Interactive (`sandbox.create()`)

Creates a persistent sandbox for multiple commands. Best for stateful workflows like dependency installation.

```typescript
import { createAgent } from '@agentuity/runtime';

const agent = createAgent('ProjectBuilder', {
  handler: async (ctx, input) => {
    const sandbox = await ctx.sandbox.create({
      resources: { memory: '1Gi' },
      network: { enabled: true },  // Required for package installation
    });

    try {
      await sandbox.execute({ command: ['npm', 'install'] });
      await sandbox.execute({ command: ['npm', 'run', 'build'] });
      return { success: true };
    } finally {
      await sandbox.destroy();
    }
  },
});
```

## SDK Access

| Context | Access |
|---------|--------|
| Agents | `ctx.sandbox` |
| Routes | `c.var.sandbox` |

The API is identical in both contexts.

## Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `runtime` | Runtime environment | `'bun:1'`, `'python:3.14'` |
| `resources.memory` | Memory limit (Kubernetes-style) | `'512Mi'`, `'1Gi'` |
| `resources.cpu` | CPU limit in millicores | `'500m'`, `'1000m'` |
| `resources.disk` | Disk space limit | `'1Gi'` |
| `network.enabled` | Allow outbound network | `true` (default: `false`) |
| `network.port` | Port to expose to internet (1024-65535) | `3000` |
| `projectId` | Associate sandbox with a project | `'proj_abc123'` |
| `timeout.idle` | Idle timeout before cleanup | `'10m'`, `'1h'` |
| `timeout.execution` | Max execution time per command | `'5m'`, `'30s'` |
| `dependencies` | Apt packages to install | `['python3', 'git']` |
| `env` | Environment variables | `{ NODE_ENV: 'test' }` |
| `snapshot` | Create from existing snapshot | `'my-env'` or `snp_abc123` |

## When to Use Sandbox

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Code execution agents | Run user-provided Python/JavaScript safely |
| Code validation | Verify generated code compiles and runs |
| AI coding assistants | Execute code suggested by LLMs |
| Automated testing | Run tests in clean environments |
| Build systems | Compile projects in isolated containers |

## Security

Sandboxes provide isolation through:

- **Network disabled by default**: Enable explicitly when needed
- **Resource limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion
- **Execution timeouts**: Prevent runaway processes
- **Filesystem isolation**: Each sandbox has its own workspace
