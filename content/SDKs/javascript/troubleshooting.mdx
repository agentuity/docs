---

This section covers common issues you might encounter when working with the Agentuity JavaScript SDK and provides solutions to help you resolve them.

### Node.js Version Issues

**Issue**: Errors related to unsupported JavaScript features or syntax.

**Solution**:
1. Verify your Node.js version meets the minimum requirement (v22+):
   <CLICommand command="node --version" />
2. If you're using an older version, upgrade Node.js:
   <CLICommand command="nvm install 22" />
   <CLICommand command="nvm use 22" />
3. If you can't upgrade Node.js, consider using a transpiler like Babel to support newer syntax in older environments.
