The [Agentuity JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/agentuity/sdk-js) provides a powerful framework for building AI agents in JavaScript and TypeScript. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for creating, deploying, and managing agents with features like key-value storage, vector storage, and OpenTelemetry integration.

## Installation

When you create a project with Agentuity, you will automatically have access to the Agentuity JavaScript SDK.

```bash
agentuity new
```

The SDK currently works with Bun and Node.js and the project will automatically install the correct dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Agentuity JavaScript SDK, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 22 or higher is required
- **Bun** (optional): Version 1.2.4 or higher is required

### Installing Node.js

You can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure to install version 22 or higher.

### Installing Bun

Bun is an optional but recommended runtime for the Agentuity SDK. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

For more information, visit the [Bun installation documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

## Welcome Function

The SDK allows you to customize the initial appearance of DevMode when it starts interacting with your agents by exporting a `welcome()` function. This function returns an `AgentWelcomeResult` object that includes a welcome message and optional example prompts.

### AgentWelcomeResult Interface

```typescript
export interface AgentWelcomePrompt {
  /**
   * The data to display to the user
   */
  data: Buffer | Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer | string | Json | Blob | ReadableStream | Data;
  /**
   * The content type of the data
   */
  contentType: string;
}

export interface AgentWelcomeResult {
  /**
   * The welcome prompt to display to the user
   */
  welcome: string;
  /**
   * The example prompts to display to the user
   */
  prompts?: AgentWelcomePrompt[];
}
```

### Example Implementation

```typescript
// agent.ts
import type { AgentHandler, AgentWelcomeResult } from '@agentuity/sdk';

export const welcome = (): AgentWelcomeResult => {
  return {
    welcome: "Welcome to my Agent! How can I help you today?",
    prompts: [
      {
        data: "What can you do?",
        contentType: "text/plain",
      },
      {
        data: "Tell me about yourself",
        contentType: "text/plain",
      }
    ],
  };
};

const handler: AgentHandler = async (request, response, context) => {
  // Agent logic
  return response.text('Hello, World!');
};

export default handler;
```

### Real-World Example

Here's a more comprehensive example from the React Miami 2025 Concierge template:

```typescript
// ConciergeHost/index.ts
import type { AgentWelcomeResult } from "@agentuity/sdk";

export const welcome = (): AgentWelcomeResult => {
  return {
    welcome: "Welcome to the React Miami 2025 Concierge! How can I help you today?",
    prompts: [
      {
        data: "Where should I go for dinner in Miami, tonight?",
        contentType: "text/plain",
      },
      {
        data: "What sessions about React hooks are happening today?",
        contentType: "text/plain",
      },
      {
        data: "Tell me more about [Speaker Name]'s background",
        contentType: "text/plain",
      },
      {
        data: "I'm hungry and looking for Cuban food near the conference",
        contentType: "text/plain",
      },
      {
        data: "What is Agentuity all about?",
        contentType: "text/plain",
      },
      {
        data: "What can I do?",
        contentType: "text/plain",
      },
    ],
  };
};
```

Note that in this example, some prompts use plain text directly while others use base64 encoding. Both approaches work, but using base64 encoding is recommended for consistency.

This will customize the DevMode interface when users interact with your agent, displaying your welcome message and providing example prompts that users can click on to quickly start a conversation.

## Development

You can start your project by running the following command:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project in development mode and open a new browser window connecting your Agent to the Agentuity Console in Live Mode.

You can also start your project in development mode without connecting to the Agentuity Console by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Or for Bun:

```bash
bun start
```

If you would like to manually test your Agents locally, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3500/run/agent_ID --json '{"input": "Hello, world!"}'
```

Make sure you replace `agent_ID` with the ID of your Agent.
