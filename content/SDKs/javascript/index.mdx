The [Agentuity JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/agentuity/sdk-js) provides a powerful framework for building AI agents in JavaScript and TypeScript. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for creating, deploying, and managing agents with features like key-value storage, vector storage, and OpenTelemetry integration.

## Installation

When you create a project with Agentuity, you will automatically have access to the Agentuity JavaScript SDK.

<CLICommand command="agentuity create" />

The SDK currently works with Bun and Node.js and the project will automatically install the correct dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Agentuity JavaScript SDK, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 22 or higher is required
- **Bun** (optional): Version 1.2.4 or higher is required

### Installing Node.js

You can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure to install version 22 or higher.

### Installing Bun

Bun is an optional but recommended runtime for the Agentuity SDK. You can install it using the following command:

<CLICommand command="curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash" />

For more information, visit the [Bun installation documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

## Development

You can start your project by running the following command:

<CLICommand command="agentuity dev" />

This will start your project in development mode and open a new browser window connecting your Agent to the Agentuity Console in Live Mode.

You can also start your project in development mode without connecting to the Agentuity Console by running the following command:

<CLICommand command="npm start" />

Or for Bun:

<CLICommand command="bun start" />

If you would like to manually test your Agents locally, you can do so by running the following command:

<CLICommand command={`curl -v http://localhost:3500/agent_ID \\\n\t--json '{"input": "Hello, world!"}'`} />

Make sure you replace `agent_ID` with the ID of your Agent.
