# Core Concepts

The Agentuity JavaScript SDK is built around several key concepts that form the foundation of agent development. Understanding these concepts is essential for effectively using the SDK.

## Agent Architecture

Agents in the Agentuity SDK are modular components that can process requests and generate responses. Each agent:

- Has a unique identifier and name
- Can be triggered by various events (webhooks, cron jobs, manual invocation, etc.)
- Processes requests through a handler function
- Has access to a context object with various capabilities

The basic structure of an agent looks like this:

```typescript
import { AgentHandler, AgentConfig } from '@agentuity/sdk';

// Agent configuration
export const config: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'my-agent',
  description: 'My first Agentuity agent'
};

// Agent handler function
const handler: AgentHandler = async (request, response, context) => {
  // Process the request
  const data = request.json();
  
  // Use the context (logging, storage, etc.)
  context.logger.info('Processing request', data);
  
  // Return a response
  return response.json({ message: 'Hello from my agent!' });
};

export default handler;
```

## Request and Response Handling

The Agentuity SDK provides a structured way to handle requests and generate responses:

### Requests

Requests contain information about the trigger event and payload data. The `AgentRequest` interface provides methods to access this data in various formats:

- `request.trigger()` - Get the trigger type (webhook, cron, etc.)
- `request.metadata()` - Access metadata associated with the request
- `request.json()` - Get the payload as a JSON object
- `request.text()` - Get the payload as a string
- `request.binary()` - Get the payload as an ArrayBuffer
- Various media-specific methods (pdf(), png(), jpeg(), etc.)

### Responses

Responses are created using the `AgentResponse` interface, which provides methods for different response types:

- `response.json()` - Return a JSON response
- `response.text()` - Return a text response
- `response.binary()` - Return a binary response
- `response.html()` - Return an HTML response
- `response.empty()` - Return an empty response
- Various media-specific methods (pdf(), png(), jpeg(), etc.)
- `response.redirect()` - Redirect to another agent

## Agent Context

The context object provides access to various capabilities and services:

- `context.logger` - Logging functionality
- `context.kv` - Key-value storage
- `context.vector` - Vector storage
- `context.getAgent()` - Access to other agents
- `context.tracer` - OpenTelemetry tracing
- Metadata about the current execution (runId, projectId, etc.)

## Triggers and Event Types

Agents can be triggered by various event types:

- `webhook` - HTTP webhook calls
- `cron` - Scheduled cron jobs
- `manual` - Manual invocation
- `agent` - Calls from other agents
- `sms` - SMS messages
- `queue` - Queue processing
- `voice` - Voice calls
- `email` - Email messages

Each trigger type may provide different metadata and payload formats, which can be accessed through the request object.
