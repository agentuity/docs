description: LLM integration for the Agentuity Python SDK
---

The Agentuity Python SDK provides a flexible and powerful way to integrate with LLMs.

## AI Gateway

The Agentuity Cloud includes an AI Gateway to make it easy to integrate LLMs with your Agent with zero configuration. The following LLM integrations are supported:

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
- [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)
- [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)
- [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/)
- [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
- [Grok](https://grok.x.ai/)
- [Groq](https://groq.com/)
- [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/)
- [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

## SDK Integrations

To use the zero config LLM integrations, you can use the following SDK integrations:

- [OpenAI Python SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)
- [Anthropic Python SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python)
- [LiteLLM Python SDK](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)

When any of the above SDKs are installed, the Agentuity Project will automatically detect it and route your requests to the AI Gateway.  However, we will only route requests if you do not provide your own LLM API Key.  By providing your own LLM API Key, the AI Gateway detection will be disabled and you will need to manually configure the LLM integration in the Agentuity App.
