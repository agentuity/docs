The [Agentuity Python SDK](https://github.com/agentuity/sdk-py) provides a powerful framework for building AI agents in Python. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for creating, deploying, and managing agents with features like key-value storage, vector storage, and OpenTelemetry integration.

## Installation

When you create a project with Agentuity, you will automatically have access to the Agentuity Python SDK.

```bash
agentuity new
```

The SDK currently works with Python and the project will automatically install the correct dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Agentuity Python SDK, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher is required

### Installing Python

You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/). Make sure to install version 3.10 or higher.

### Installing UV

[UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is an optional but recommended package manager for Python. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

For more information, visit the [UV installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## Welcome Function

The SDK allows you to customize the initial appearance of DevMode when it starts interacting with your agents by defining a `welcome()` function in your agent module. This function should return a dictionary containing a welcome message and optional example prompts.

### Example Implementation

```python
# agent.py

def welcome():
    return {
        "welcome": "Welcome to my Python Agent! How can I help you today?",
        "prompts": [
            {
                "data": "What can you do?",
                "contentType": "text/plain"
            },
            {
                "data": "Tell me about yourself",
                "contentType": "text/plain"
            }
        ]
    }

def run(request, response, context):
    # Agent logic
    return response.text("Hello, World!")
```

### Real-World Example

Here's a more comprehensive example inspired by the React Miami 2025 Concierge template:

```python
# concierge_agent.py

def welcome():
    return {
        "welcome": "Welcome to the Python Concierge! How can I help you today?",
        "prompts": [
            {
                "data": "Where should I go for dinner in Miami, tonight?",
                "contentType": "text/plain"
            },
            {
                "data": "What sessions about Python are happening today?",
                "contentType": "text/plain"
            },
            {
                "data": "Tell me more about the conference speakers",
                "contentType": "text/plain"
            },
            {
                "data": "I'm looking for good restaurants near the venue",
                "contentType": "text/plain"
            },
            {
                "data": "What is Agentuity all about?",
                "contentType": "text/plain"
            }
        ]
    }

def run(request, response, context):
    # Agent logic implementation
    return response.text("Hello, I'm your Python Concierge!")
```



This will customize the DevMode interface when users interact with your agent, displaying your welcome message and providing example prompts that users can click on to quickly start a conversation.

## Development

You can start your project by running the following command:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project in development mode and open a new browser window connecting your Agent to the Agentuity Console in Live Mode.

You can also start your project in development mode without connecting to the Agentuity Console by running the following command:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

If you would like to manually test your Agents locally, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3500/run/agent_ID --json '{"input": "Hello, world!"}'
```

Make sure you replace `agent_ID` with the ID of your Agent.
