description: From local development to global production

You've built agents with memory, collaboration, and production-grade guardrails. Now let's deploy them properly.

## The Reality of Enterprise Agent Deployment

Research shows that [most organizations aren't "agent-ready"](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-agents-2025-expectations-vs-reality) - they lack the infrastructure, processes, and understanding needed for production agents. When [Salesforce automated 50% of their support cases](https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/salesforce-ai-job-cuts-benioff-21025920.php), it required massive organizational change alongside the technology.

The challenge isn't just technical - it's operational:
- How do you test non-deterministic agents?
- How do you safely roll out changes that affect customer interactions?
- How do you monitor agents that make autonomous decisions?
- How do you handle failures gracefully when agents are unpredictable?

## The Agentuity Environment Model

Agentuity provides three distinct environments, each with specific purposes:

### Development Environment
**Where ideas become agents**

Your local machine running DevMode:
- Instant feedback with hot reload
- Full debugging capabilities
- Mock external services
- Unlimited iterations
- Direct file system access

```bash
# Start local development
agentuity dev

# Test with real-time changes
# Edit → Save → Test immediately
```

### Staging Environment
**Where agents prove themselves**

<Callout type="info">
**Coming Soon**: Dedicated staging environments with production-like infrastructure but isolated from real users.
</Callout>

Cloud deployment with test data:
- Production infrastructure
- Synthetic test data
- Full observability
- Performance testing
- Integration testing

```bash
# Deploy to staging (coming soon)
```

### Production Environment
**Where agents serve users**

Full-scale deployment:
- Auto-scaling infrastructure
- Real user traffic
- Complete monitoring
- High availability
- Disaster recovery

```bash
# Deploy to production
agentuity deploy
```

## Environment Progression

### Moving Through Environments

Each environment serves as a gate to the next:

| Stage | Purpose | Key Validation | Duration |
|-------|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Local Dev** | Build & iterate | Basic functionality | Hours to days |
| **Staging** | Validate at scale | Performance, integration | Days to weeks |
| **Production** | Serve users | Monitoring, optimization | Ongoing |

### Environment Testing Matrix

Each environment requires different testing focus:

| Testing Aspect | Development | Staging | Production |
|----------------|------------|---------|------------|
| **Core Functionality** | Basic input/output validation | Load testing with concurrent users | Success rate metrics |
| **Memory & State** | Memory operations work correctly | Memory cleanup under load | Response time percentiles |
| **Error Handling** | Validation catches bad inputs | Rate limiting works correctly | Error rate trends |
| **Observability** | Logs provide debugging info | Meaningful telemetry spans | Cost per request tracking |
| **Integration** | Error messages are helpful | External service integration | User satisfaction signals |
| **Resilience** | Basic error recovery | Failover and recovery testing | Incident response time |

## Enterprise Deployment Options

<Callout type="info">
**Coming Soon**: Advanced deployment options for enterprise customers with specific compliance and security requirements.
</Callout>

### Private Cloud Deployments
Deploy Agentuity infrastructure in your own cloud account. More information coming soon.

### On-Premise Installations
Run Agentuity entirely within your data center. More information coming soon.

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Settings

Different environments need different configurations:

<CodeExample py={`# config.py
import os

class Config:
    """Environment-specific configuration"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.env = os.getenv("AGENTUITY_ENVIRONMENT", "development")
        
        # Environment-specific settings
        if self.env == "development":
            self.log_level = "DEBUG"
            self.rate_limit = 1000  # Generous for testing
            self.cache_ttl = 60  # Short for quick iterations
        elif self.env == "staging":
            self.log_level = "INFO"
            self.rate_limit = 100
            self.cache_ttl = 300
        else:  # production
            self.log_level = "WARNING"
            self.rate_limit = 50
            self.cache_ttl = 3600
            
        # Feature flags
        self.enable_experimental = self.env != "production"
        self.verbose_errors = self.env == "development"`} js={`// config.js
class Config {
  constructor() {
    this.env = process.env.AGENTUITY_ENVIRONMENT || 'development';
    
    // Environment-specific settings
    switch(this.env) {
      case 'development':
        this.logLevel = 'DEBUG';
        this.rateLimit = 1000;  // Generous for testing
        this.cacheTTL = 60;  // Short for quick iterations
        break;
      case 'staging':
        this.logLevel = 'INFO';
        this.rateLimit = 100;
        this.cacheTTL = 300;
        break;
      default:  // production
        this.logLevel = 'WARNING';
        this.rateLimit = 50;
        this.cacheTTL = 3600;
    }
    
    // Feature flags
    this.enableExperimental = this.env !== 'production';
    this.verboseErrors = this.env === 'development';
  }
}

export default new Config();`} />

## Real-World Deployment Lessons

### Enterprise Scale: Salesforce's Journey

When Salesforce deployed agents to handle 50% of support cases, they learned:
- **Gradual rollout is essential**: Started with 1% of tickets
- **Human oversight needed initially**: Agents flagged uncertain responses
- **Continuous improvement**: Daily model updates based on outcomes
- **Organizational change**: Required retraining support staff

### Financial Services: 100+ GenAI Applications

[CB Insights reports over 100 GenAI applications in financial services](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/generative-ai-financial-services-applications-2025/). Banks deploying agents discovered:
- **Compliance first**: Every response needs audit trails
- **Failover critical**: Instant human handoff when needed
- **Cost management**: Token limits per customer interaction
- **Security paramount**: No customer data in prompts

## Lab: Deploy Your Financial Advisor

Let's deploy the financial advisor from Module 5:

### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

```bash
# Ensure all tests pass
npm test  # or python -m pytest

# Check environment variables
agentuity config verify

# Build for production
agentuity build
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Deploy with confirmation
agentuity deploy --confirm

# Monitor deployment
agentuity logs --follow

# Check health
agentuity status
```

### Step 3: Monitor in Production

View your deployment in the Agentuity console:
- Real-time metrics
- Session traces
- Error tracking
- Cost analysis

## What's Next?

You now understand the deployment journey from local development to production. But how do you build complete, production-ready systems that combine everything you've learned?

In the next module, we'll tackle the capstone project - building a full agent system that uses:
- Memory and state management
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Production guardrails
- Comprehensive observability
- Proper deployment practices

But first, experiment with deployment:
- Deploy your agents to production
- Monitor their performance
- Try different configurations
- Practice rollback procedures
