description: From local development to global production

You've built agents with memory, collaboration, and production-grade guardrails. Now let's deploy them properly.

## The Reality of Enterprise Agent Deployment

Research shows that [most organizations aren't "agent-ready"](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-agents-2025-expectations-vs-reality) - they lack the infrastructure, processes, and understanding needed for production agents. When [Salesforce deployed their Agentforce AI agents](https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2025/03/04/salesforce-ai-agents-reskilling), it required massive organizational change alongside the technology.

The challenge involves both technical and operational considerations:
- How do you test non-deterministic agents?
- How do you safely roll out changes that affect customer interactions?
- How do you monitor agents that make autonomous decisions?
- How do you handle failures gracefully when agents are unpredictable?

## The Agentuity Environment Model

Agentuity provides three distinct environments, each with specific purposes:

### Development Environment
**Where ideas become agents**

Your local machine running DevMode:
- Instant feedback with hot reload
- Full debugging capabilities
- Observability provided by Traceloop (OpenTelemetry integration)
- Access to Agentuity API features (memory, etc)

```bash
# Start local development
agentuity dev

# Test with real-time changes
# Edit → Save → Test immediately
```

### Staging Environment
**Where agents prove themselves**

<Callout type="info">
**Coming Soon**: Dedicated staging environments with production-like infrastructure but isolated from real users.
</Callout>

Cloud deployment with test data:
- Full observability
- Options for different deployment configurations
- Ability to use different keys and environment variables

```bash
# Deploy to staging (coming soon)
```

### Production Environment
**Where agents serve users**

Full-scale deployment:
- Auto-scaling infrastructure
- Complete monitoring, with the exact same experience as local development

```bash
# Deploy to production
agentuity deploy
```

## Environment Progression

### Moving Through Environments

The typical flow moves from local development to production with clear validation at each stage:

| Stage | Purpose | Key Focus | Typical Timeline |
|-------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Local Dev** | Build & iterate rapidly | Feature development | Hours to days |
| **Staging** | Validate production readiness | Performance & integration testing | Days to weeks |
| **Production** | Serve real users | Monitoring & optimization | Ongoing |

### Environment Validation Focus

Each environment emphasizes different aspects of your agent's readiness:

| Focus Area | Development | Staging | Production |
|------------|------------|---------|------------|
| **Functionality** | Core features work | Load & stress testing | Success metrics |
| **Memory & State** | Memory operations function | Memory performance under load | Response time tracking |
| **Error Handling** | Validation works | Rate limiting effective | Error rate monitoring |
| **Observability** | Debug information available | Telemetry accuracy | Performance insights |
| **Integration** | Error messages helpful | External service testing | User experience metrics |
| **Resilience** | Basic error recovery | Failover mechanisms | Incident response |

## Enterprise Deployment Options

<Callout type="info">
**Coming Soon**: Advanced deployment options for enterprise customers with specific compliance and security requirements.
</Callout>

### Private Cloud Deployments
Deploy Agentuity infrastructure in your own cloud account. More information coming soon!

### On-Premise Installations
Run Agentuity entirely within your data center. More information coming soon!

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Settings

Different environments need different configurations:

{/* Environment-specific settings are typically configured through the Agentuity web console.
Screenshots showing the web UI for environment configuration will be added here.

The web console allows you to set:
- Environment variables per deployment
- Rate limiting and caching settings
- Feature flags and deployment options
- Observability and monitoring configuration */}

*Environment-specific settings are managed through the Agentuity web console. Screenshots of the configuration interface will be provided here.*

## Real-World Deployment Lessons

### Enterprise Scale: Salesforce's Journey

When Salesforce deployed agents to handle 50% of support cases, they learned:
- **Gradual rollout is essential**: Started with 1% of tickets
- **Human oversight needed initially**: Agents flagged uncertain responses
- **Continuous improvement**: Daily model updates based on outcomes
- **Organizational change**: Required retraining support staff

### Financial Services: 100+ GenAI Applications

[CB Insights reports over 100 GenAI applications in financial services](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/generative-ai-financial-services-applications-2025/). Banks deploying agents discovered:
- **Compliance first**: Every response needs audit trails
- **Failover critical**: Instant human handoff when needed
- **Cost management**: Token limits per customer interaction
- **Security paramount**: No customer data in prompts

## Lab: Deploy Your Financial Advisor

Let's deploy the financial advisor from Module 5:

### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

```bash
# Ensure all tests pass
npm test  # or python -m pytest

# Check environment variables
agentuity config verify

# Build for production
agentuity build
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Deploy with confirmation
agentuity deploy --confirm

# Monitor deployment
agentuity logs --follow

# Check health
agentuity status
```

### Step 3: Monitor in Production

View your deployment in the Agentuity console:
- Real-time metrics
- Session traces
- Error tracking
- Cost analysis

## What's Next?

You now understand the deployment journey from local development to production. But how do you build complete, production-ready systems that combine everything you've learned?

In the next module, we'll tackle the capstone project - building a full agent system that uses:
- Memory and state management
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Production guardrails
- Comprehensive observability
- Proper deployment practices

But first, experiment with deployment:
- Deploy your agents to production
- Monitor their performance
- Try different configurations
- Practice rollback procedures
