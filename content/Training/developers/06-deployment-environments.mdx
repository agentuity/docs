title: "Module 6: Deployment Environments"
description: From local development to global production
---

You've built agents with memory, collaboration, and production-grade guardrails. Now let's deploy them properly.

## The Agentuity Environment Model

Agentuity provides three distinct environments, each with specific purposes:

### Development Environment
**Where ideas become agents**

Your local machine running DevMode:
- Instant feedback with hot reload
- Full debugging capabilities
- Observability provided by OpenTelemetry integration
- Access to Agentuity API features (memory, etc)

```bash
# Start local development
agentuity dev

# Test with real-time changes
# Edit → Save → Test immediately
```

### Staging Environment
**Where agents prove themselves**

<Callout type="success">
**Now Available**: Staging environments are here! Test your agents with production-like infrastructure before going live.
</Callout>

Cloud deployment with test data:
- Full observability
- Options for different deployment configurations
- Ability to use different keys and environment variables

### Production Environment
**Where agents live**

Full-scale deployment:
- Auto-scaling infrastructure
- Complete monitoring, with the exact same experience as local development

```bash
# Deploy to production
agentuity deploy
```

## Preview Deployments

**Testing changes in the cloud before production**

<Callout type="success">
**Preview deployments are here!** Automatically test your PR changes in the cloud before merging.
</Callout>

Preview deployments allow you to test agent modifications in a cloud environment automatically when you create pull requests, giving you confidence before merging to production.

### How Preview Deployments Work

1. **Enable in Console**: Turn on preview deployments for your repository
2. **Create Pull Request**: Open a PR with your agent changes
3. **Automatic Deployment**: Agentuity automatically deploys your changes to a preview environment
4. **Test with Unique URLs**: Each preview gets unique URLs with git hash tagging
5. **Merge with Confidence**: Test thoroughly before merging to production

### Setting Up Preview Deployments

Enable preview deployments in your repository settings through the Agentuity console with a simple toggle switch.

### PR Integration

When you create a pull request, Agentuity automatically comments with:
- Direct links to your preview deployment
- Curl examples for API testing
- Deployment logs and monitoring links
- Configuration details from your agentuity.yaml

### Preview Environment Access

Each preview deployment gets tagged URLs that include your git commit hash, allowing precise testing of specific changes.

<Callout type="info">
**Current Status**: Preview deployments share production resources for storage (KV, vector, object store). Full resource isolation is coming soon.
</Callout>

### Benefits for Development Teams

- **Collaborative testing**: Share preview links with team members and stakeholders
- **Integration validation**: Test with real external APIs in cloud environment
- **Performance insights**: See how changes perform under cloud conditions
- **Risk reduction**: Catch issues before they reach production users

## Environment Progression

### Moving Through Environments

The typical flow moves from local development to production with clear validation at each stage:

| Stage | Purpose | Key Focus | Typical Timeline |
|-------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Local Dev** | Build & iterate rapidly | Feature development | Hours to days |
| **Preview** | Test changes in cloud | PR validation & team collaboration | Minutes to hours |
| **Staging** | Validate production readiness | Performance & integration testing | Days to weeks |
| **Production** | Serve real users | Monitoring & optimization | Ongoing |

### Environment Validation Focus

Each environment emphasizes different aspects of your agent's readiness:

| Focus Area | Development | Preview | Staging | Production |
|------------|------------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Functionality** | Core features work | Change validation | Load & stress testing | Success metrics |
| **Memory & State** | Memory operations function | Data integration testing | Memory performance under load | Response time tracking |
| **Error Handling** | Validation works | Edge case testing | Rate limiting effective | Error rate monitoring |
| **Observability** | Debug information available | Cloud behavior verification | Telemetry accuracy | Performance insights |
| **Integration** | Error messages helpful | Real API testing | External service testing | User experience metrics |
| **Resilience** | Basic error recovery | Team collaboration | Failover mechanisms | Incident response |

## Enterprise Deployment Options

<Callout type="info">
**Coming Soon**: Advanced deployment options for enterprise customers with specific compliance and security requirements.
</Callout>

### Private Cloud Deployments

**Complete infrastructure control via CLI**

<Callout type="info">
**Coming Soon**: Create and manage your own Agentuity clusters with full control over infrastructure, compliance, and data sovereignty.
</Callout>

#### Multi-Cloud Support
Deploy Agentuity infrastructure on your preferred cloud provider with full region selection:
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** - All AWS regions
- **Microsoft Azure** - Global Azure regions
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** - Worldwide GCP regions
- **VMware** - On-premise and private cloud deployments

#### Flexible Cluster Sizing
Choose the right cluster size for your workload:

| Size | Use Case | Typical Workload |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Dev** | Development & testing | Individual developers, proof of concepts |
| **Small** | Team deployments | Small teams, departmental use |
| **Medium** | Production workloads | Multiple teams, moderate scale |
| **Large** | Enterprise scale | High-volume production, multiple business units |

#### Complete Cluster Management
Create and manage clusters through the command-line interface with full control over:

- **Cluster Creation**: New cluster provisioning across supported providers
- **Region Selection**: Choose optimal geographic deployment locations
- **Machine Management**: List, remove, and monitor individual cluster machines
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time cluster health and performance visibility

#### Deployment Options
- **Automated Setup**: Streamlined cloud provider integration
- **Manual Setup**: Step-by-step guidance for custom configurations
- **Full Control**: Complete networking, security, and resource customization

#### Enterprise Benefits
- **Data Sovereignty**: Keep all data within your infrastructure boundaries
- **Compliance Control**: Meet specific regulatory and security requirements
- **Performance Optimization**: Deploy closer to your users and data sources
- **Cost Management**: Direct control over resource allocation and scaling

### On-Premise Installations
**VMware-based deployments for complete on-premise control**

Run Agentuity entirely within your data center using VMware infrastructure. Perfect for organizations requiring complete air-gapped deployments or specific hardware control.

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Settings

Different environments need different configurations:

<Callout type="info">
Environment-specific settings are configured in the Agentuity web console. More information coming soon.
</Callout>

## Real-World Deployment Lessons

### Enterprise Scale: Salesforce's Journey

When Salesforce deployed agents to handle 50% of support cases, they learned:
- **Gradual rollout is essential**: Started with 1% of tickets
- **Human oversight needed initially**: Agents flagged uncertain responses
- **Continuous improvement**: Daily model updates based on outcomes
- **Organizational change**: Required retraining support staff

### Financial Services: 100+ GenAI Applications

[CB Insights reports over 100 GenAI applications in financial services](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/generative-ai-financial-services-applications-2025/). Banks deploying agents discovered:
- **Compliance first**: Every response needs audit trails
- **Failover critical**: Instant human handoff when needed
- **Cost management**: Token limits per customer interaction
- **Security paramount**: No customer data in prompts

## What's Next?

You now understand the deployment journey from local development to production. But how do you build complete, production-ready systems that combine everything you've learned?

In the next module, we'll tackle the capstone project - building a full agent system that uses:
- Memory and state management
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Production guardrails
- Comprehensive observability
- Proper deployment practices
