title: "Module 1: Introduction to Agents"
description: Understanding AI agents and the $47B opportunity
---

Welcome to the age of AI agents - autonomous systems that are fundamentally transforming how we build and think about software.

## The $47B Agent Opportunity

The AI agents market is exploding - projected to grow from [$5.1B in 2024 to $47.1B by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-agents-market-15761548.html) at a staggering 44.8% CAGR. According to [IBM's latest research](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-agents-2025-expectations-vs-reality), many developers are already exploring or building AI agents. 

But here's the problem: most developers are trying to build autonomous systems on infrastructure designed for websites, not agents.

As [Goldman Sachs' infrastructure analysis](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/a-generational-infrastructure-buildout-might-hinge-on-ai-agents) points out:

> "We're trying to run autonomous systems on infrastructure built for click-and-response websites. It's like trying to run a Tesla on roads designed for horses."

Traditional cloud platforms (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) were optimized for:
- **5ms response times** (agents need minutes or hours to think)
- **Stateless execution** (agents need persistent memory)
- **Edge distribution** (agents need GPU proximity)

This makes them poorly suited for:
- **Long-running reasoning** processes that require extended compute time
- **Persistent state management** across multiple interactions
- **Complex agent workflows** that span multiple reasoning cycles

## What Exactly Is an AI Agent?

<Callout type="info">
For a comprehensive overview of agents and how they differ from traditional software, see our [What is an Agent?](/Guides/what-is-an-agent) guide.
</Callout>

An AI agent is not just another chatbot or API wrapper around an LLM. It's a fundamentally different type of software that combines a LLM with **memory, tools, and a reasoning loop**.

### The Agent Formula
```
Agent = LLM + Memory + Tools + Reasoning Loop
```

Let's break this down:

1. **LLM (Large Language Model)**: The "brain" that understands intent and generates responses
2. **Memory**: Both short-term (conversation context) and long-term (persistent knowledge)
3. **Tools**: Capabilities to interact with external systems, APIs, and data sources
4. **Reasoning Loop**: The ability to plan, execute, observe results, and adapt

### Agents vs. Everything Else

| Traditional API | Chatbot | AI Agent |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| Waits for commands | Responds to messages | Acts autonomously |
| Returns exactly what you ask | Follows scripted patterns | Figures out how to achieve goals |
| Stateless between calls | Maintains conversation context | Remembers everything, learns over time |
| Deterministic output | Limited variation | Adapts based on context |
| Single request-response | Turn-based conversation | Continuous reasoning and action |

Think of it this way:
- **APIs** are like vending machines - push button, get result
- **Chatbots** are like scripted receptionists - they can talk, but only follow a script
- **Agents** are like smart assistants - they understand goals and figure out how to achieve them

## The Paradigm Shift: From Deterministic to Non-Deterministic

<Callout type="info">
For deeper insights on this shift, read our [Agent Engineering](/Guides/agent-engineering) guide that covers thinking like an agent builder.
</Callout>

Traditional software engineering is built on determinism - given the same input, you always get the same output. We write explicit logic for every scenario:

<CodeExample py={`# Traditional deterministic approach
def process_customer_request(request_type, data):
    if request_type == "refund":
        if data["amount"] < 100:
            return process_refund(data)
        else:
            return escalate_to_manager(data)
    elif request_type == "complaint":
        return create_ticket(data)
    # ... hundreds more conditions`} js={`// Traditional deterministic approach
function processCustomerRequest(requestType, data) {
  if (requestType === 'refund') {
    if (data.amount < 100) {
      return processRefund(data);
    } else {
      return escalateToManager(data);
    }
  } else if (requestType === 'complaint') {
    return createTicket(data);
  }
  // ... hundreds more conditions
}`} />

Agent engineering embraces non-determinism - the agent interprets intent and figures out the best approach:

<CodeExample py={`# Agent-based approach
async def handle_customer_request(request, context):
    # Agent interprets the request
    intent = await analyze_intent(request)

    # Agent decides on approach
    plan = await create_action_plan(intent, context.customer_history)

    # Agent executes with available tools
    result = await execute_plan(plan, context.available_tools)

    # Agent learns from outcome
    await update_knowledge(result, context.memory)

    return result`} js={`// Agent-based approach
const handleCustomerRequest = async (request, context) => {
  // Agent interprets the request
  const intent = await analyzeIntent(request);

  // Agent decides on approach
  const plan = await createActionPlan(intent, context.customerHistory);

  // Agent executes with available tools
  const result = await executePlan(plan, context.availableTools);

  // Agent learns from outcome
  await updateKnowledge(result, context.memory);

  return result;
};`} />

This shift requires a new mindset:
- **Design for intent**, not implementation
- **Embrace variability** as a feature, not a bug
- **Think in capabilities**, not functions
- **Trust but verify** - use guardrails and observability

## Why Agents Need Agent-Native Infrastructure

[Microsoft's analysis](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/05/19/microsoft-build-2025-the-age-of-ai-agents-and-building-the-open-agentic-web/) confirms that "most organizations aren't agent-ready" because their infrastructure wasn't built for autonomous systems.

### The Infrastructure Mismatch

Traditional cloud platforms face fundamental limitations when running agents:

| Traditional Cloud | What Agents Need | The Gap |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| 15-second timeouts | Long-running processes | Agents timeout mid-thought |
| Stateless by default | Persistent memory | Agents forget everything |
| Distributed to edge | GPU proximity | High latency to AI models |
| Pay per request | Continuous operation | Costs explode unexpectedly |
| Human-centric monitoring | Agent observability | Can't debug agent decisions |

Major cloud providers like AWS, Google, and Microsoft are working to adapt their platforms for agents.

But retrofitting existing infrastructure is like turning a highway into an airport - technically possible, but not optimal.

## Enter Agentuity: The Agent-Native Cloud

<Callout type="info">
Learn more about the Agent-Native Cloud paradigm in our [Agent-Native Cloud](/Guides/agent-native-cloud) guide.
</Callout>

While others retrofit, Agentuity was built from day one specifically for agents. Agentuity's agent-native platform puts AI agents at the center of everything.

### The Agentuity Difference: Purpose-Built for Agents

Instead of asking "How do we make Lambda work for agents?", we asked "What would infrastructure look like if agents were the only thing that mattered?"

Agentuity provides what agents actually need:

- **Long-running processes**: Agents can think for hours, not seconds
- **Persistent memory**: Built-in [key-value](/Guides/key-value), [vector](/Guides/vector-db), and [object storage](/Guides/object-storage)
- **Agent-to-agent communication**: Seamless and secure [channels between agents](/Guides/agent-communication)
- **Native observability**: Track agent decisions with [built-in tracing](/Guides/agent-tracing)
- **Automatic scaling**: Based on agent workload, not request count
- **Framework agnostic**: Run LangChain, CrewAI, or custom agents side by side - and easily integrate with popular tools like the Vercel AI SDK for streamlined AI development

The result is a platform where agents are first-class citizens, not adapted workloads; memory and state are built-in, not bolted on; long-running is the default, not an exception; and agent communication is native, not a hack.

## Your First Agent: Hello, Autonomous World

Now that you have an understanding of what agents are and why they need specialized infrastructure, let's build your first agent.

### Prerequisites

<Callout type="info">
For detailed setup instructions, see our [Getting Started Guide](/Introduction/getting-started) and [CLI Installation Guide](/CLI/installation).
</Callout>

Before we start, make sure you have:
- Python 3.9+ or Node.js 18+
- Basic command line knowledge
- An Agentuity account (free tier is fine)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Install the Agentuity CLI

# NPM (if you have Node.js)
npm install -g @agentuity/cli

# Bun (if you have Bun)
bun install -g @agentuity/cli

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew tap agentuity/tap && brew install agentuity

# Universal installer (Windows/Linux/macOS)
curl -fsS https://agentuity.sh | sh
# Note: Verify the checksum from https://agentuity.com/install for security

# Direct download from releases
# Visit https://github.com/agentuity/cli/releases for your platform

# Verify installation
agentuity --version

# Login to your account
agentuity auth login
```

### Creating Your First Agent Project

Let's create a simple agent that demonstrates the key concepts we've learned:

```bash
# Create a new agent project
agentuity create hello-agent --template typescript-starter
# or for Python:
# agentuity create hello-agent --template python-starter

# Navigate to the project
cd hello-agent

# Install dependencies (TypeScript)
npm install
# or for Python:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Understanding the Agent Structure

Here's a simple "Hello Agent" that demonstrates the core concepts:

<CodeExample py={`from agentuity import AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext

async def run(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext):
    # Get the name from request data
    data = await request.data.json()
    name = data.get("name", "World")

    # Return a simple greeting
    return response.json({"message": f"Hello, {name}!"})`} js={`import type { AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext } from "@agentuity/sdk";

export default async function Agent(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext) {
  // Get the name from request data
  const data = await request.data.json();
  const name = data.name || 'World';

  // Return a simple greeting
  return response.json({ message: \`Hello, \${name}!\` });
}`} />

This simple agent demonstrates:
- **Request handling**: Accepts JSON input with a `name` field
- **Response generation**: Returns a personalized greeting
- **Agentuity patterns**: Uses the standard request/response structure
- **Agent-native infrastructure**: Runs on infrastructure built for agents

### Adding Observability and State

Let's enhance our agent with logging and a simple state counter:

<CodeExample py={`from datetime import datetime
from agentuity import AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext

async def run(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext):
    # Log the incoming request (built-in observability)
    context.logger.info("Hello agent received a request")

    # Get the name from request data
    data = await request.data.json()
    name = data.get("name", "World")

    # Simple counter using KV storage
    counter_result = await context.kv.get("stats", "greeting_count")
    if counter_result.exists:
        count = await counter_result.data.json()
        count += 1
    else:
        count = 1

    # Update the counter
    await context.kv.set("stats", "greeting_count", count)

    context.logger.info(f"Greeting #{count} for {name}")

    # Return a greeting with some stats
    return response.json({
        "message": f"Hello, {name}!",
        "greeting_number": count,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    })`} js={`import type { AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext } from "@agentuity/sdk";

export default async function Agent(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext) {
  // Log the incoming request (built-in observability)
  context.logger.info('Hello agent received a request');

  // Get the name from request data
  const data = await request.data.json();
  const name = data.name || 'World';

  // Simple counter using KV storage
  const counterResult = await context.kv.get('stats', 'greeting_count');
  let count;
  if (counterResult.exists) {
    count = await counterResult.data.json();
    count++;
  } else {
    count = 1;
  }

  // Update the counter
  await context.kv.set('stats', 'greeting_count', count);

  context.logger.info(\`Greeting #\${count} for \${name}\`);

  // Return a greeting with some stats
  return response.json({
    message: \`Hello, \${name}!\`,
    greeting_number: count,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}`} />

This enhanced agent demonstrates:
- **Comprehensive Observability**: Built-in logging with context.logger plus automatic OpenTelemetry tracing that captures all operations (storage calls, external requests) as structured spans without any additional code
- **State Management**: Simple counter using key-value storage
- **Agent Memory**: One storage type (KV) without complexity
- **Request/Response**: JSON input and structured output

### Testing Your Agent with DevMode

<Callout type="info">
DevMode is Agentuity's local development environment that provides instant feedback, complete observability, and a user-friendly web interface for testing agents.
</Callout>

Test your agent using Agentuity's DevMode:

```bash
# Start DevMode - your agent will be available with a web interface
agentuity dev

# DevMode will start and show:
# 🚀 DevMode ready
# 🌐 Local: http://localhost:3500
# 🔗 Public: https://[unique-id].agentuity.dev (for external access)
```

Once DevMode is running:
1. Open the provided URL in your browser
2. Select your agent from the dropdown
3. Use the pre-configured prompts or write your own test scenarios
4. Click "Run" to execute tests instantly
5. View real-time logs, costs, and performance metrics in the interface

#### Making Testing Easier with the Welcome Function

Add a `welcome()` function to your agent to create clickable test scenarios in DevMode:

<CodeExample py={`from agentuity import AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext

def welcome():
    """Configure test scenarios for DevMode."""
    return {
        "welcome": "Welcome to my Hello Agent! Try these examples:",
        "prompts": [
            {
                "data": {"name": "Sarah"},
                "contentType": "application/json"
            },
            {
                "data": {"name": "DevMode Tester"},
                "contentType": "application/json"
            },
            {
                "data": {"name": ""},  # Test missing name
                "contentType": "application/json"
            }
        ]
    }

async def run(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext):
    # Your existing agent code...`} js={`import type { AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext } from "@agentuity/sdk";

export const welcome = () => {
    return {
        welcome: "Welcome to my Hello Agent! Try these examples:",
        prompts: [
            {
                data: JSON.stringify({ name: "Sarah" }),
                contentType: "application/json"
            },
            {
                data: JSON.stringify({ name: "DevMode Tester" }),
                contentType: "application/json"
            },
            {
                data: JSON.stringify({ name: "" }), // Test missing name
                contentType: "application/json"
            }
        ]
    };
};

export default async function Agent(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext) {
    // Your existing agent code...`} />

These prompts appear as clickable buttons in the DevMode interface. Try calling the agent multiple times with the same name - it will remember you, and you can see the memory operations in the real-time logs!

### Deploying to the Agentuity Cloud

Now let's deploy this agent to production:

```bash
# Deploy to Agentuity's agent-native infrastructure
agentuity deploy

# Your deployment will show:
# Deployment successful
# Agent URL: https://[unique-id].agentuity.com
# Dashboard: https://console.agentuity.com/projects/[project-id]
```

That's it! Your agent is now:
- Running in long-running infrastructure (no timeout worries)
- Storing memory persistently (survives restarts)
- Fully observable (check logs and traces in the dashboard)
- Auto-scaling based on load

## Lab: Extending Your Agent

Now that you have a working agent, let's enhance it with more capabilities. Use DevMode to test each enhancement as you build it.

### Challenge 1: Add Error Handling
Enhance your agent with proper error handling and validation:

<CodeExample py={`# Key pattern: Defensive error handling
try:
    data = await request.data.json()
    name = data.get("name")

    if not name:
        context.logger.warn("No name provided in request")
        return response.json({"error": "Name is required"})

    # Your agent logic here...`} js={`// Key pattern: Defensive error handling
try {
  const data = await request.data.json();
  const name = data.name;

  if (!name) {
    context.logger.warn('No name provided in request');
    return response.json({ error: 'Name is required' });
  }

  // Your agent logic here...`} />

### Challenge 2: Handle Multiple Input Types
Enhance your agent to handle both JSON and text inputs gracefully:

<CodeExample py={`# Key pattern: Flexible input handling
try:
    if request.data.contentType == "application/json":
        data = await request.data.json()
        name = data.get("name", "World")
    elif request.data.contentType == "text/plain":
        name = await request.data.text() or "World"
    else:
        name = "World"
except Exception as e:
    context.logger.error(f"Error parsing request: {e}")
    name = "World"  # Graceful fallback`} js={`// Key pattern: Flexible input handling
let name = 'World';
try {
  if (request.data.contentType === 'application/json') {
    const data = await request.data.json();
    name = data.name || 'World';
  } else if (request.data.contentType === 'text/plain') {
    name = await request.data.text() || 'World';
  }
} catch (error) {
  context.logger.error(\`Error parsing request: \${error}\`);
  // Graceful fallback to default
}`} />

### Challenge 3: Complete Production Implementation

Now let's combine all features (and add some simple storage provided by Agentuity) into a fully-functional agent.

This complete implementation demonstrates:
- **Error handling** with try/catch
- **Multiple content types** (JSON and text input support)
- **Statistics tracking** (personal greeting counts)
- **Memory management** (stores only last 5 names)
- **TTL storage** (24-hour expiration on stats)
- **DevMode integration** with clickable test scenarios via `welcome()`
- **Logging** for debugging and monitoring

## Testing Your Complete Agent

After implementing this complete version:
1. Run `agentuity dev` to start DevMode
2. Use the clickable prompts from the `welcome()` function
3. Test with both JSON and text inputs
4. Call the agent multiple times with the same name to see statistics
5. Monitor the logs to see detailed operation tracking
6. Check the key-value storage to see the personal greeting counts
7. Check the Sessions tab for performance metrics

<Callout type="info">
This complete implementation shows production patterns you'll use throughout the training modules. Notice how we handle errors gracefully, store data efficiently, and provide rich observability.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

- **Agents are different**: They're autonomous systems, not just API wrappers around LLMs
- **The market is massive**: $47B by 2030, with many developers already building agents
- **Infrastructure matters**: Traditional cloud wasn't built for agents' unique needs
- **Non-determinism is a feature**: Agents adapt and reason, they don't just execute
- **Agentuity is agent-native**: Purpose-built infrastructure for agents, not retrofitted

## What's Next?

You've just built and deployed your first agent on infrastructure designed specifically for agents. In the next module, we'll dive deeper into the anatomy of an agent - understanding planning, reasoning loops, tool invocation, and how agents really work under the hood.

But first, take a moment to experiment with your agent. Try:
- Calling it with different names and at different times
- Checking the logs in the DevMode interface
- Calling it multiple times to see the counter increment
- Testing error cases like missing names
- Monitoring the key-value storage in the dashboard

Remember: you're not just learning a new framework, you're learning a fundamentally new way to build software. Welcome to the age of agents!
