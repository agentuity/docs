title: "Module 1: Introduction to Agents"
description: Understanding AI agents and the $47B opportunity
---

Welcome to the age of AI agents - autonomous systems that are fundamentally transforming how we build and think about software.

## The $47B Agent Opportunity

The AI agents market is exploding - projected to grow from [$5.1B in 2024 to $47.1B by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-agents-market-15761548.html) at a staggering 44.8% CAGR. According to [IBM's latest research](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-agents-2025-expectations-vs-reality), many developers are already exploring or building AI agents. 

But here's the problem: most developers are trying to build autonomous systems on infrastructure designed for websites, not agents.

As [Goldman Sachs' infrastructure analysis](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/a-generational-infrastructure-buildout-might-hinge-on-ai-agents) points out:

> "We're trying to run autonomous systems on infrastructure built for click-and-response websites. It's like trying to run a Tesla on roads designed for horses."

Traditional cloud platforms (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) were optimized for:
- **5ms response times** (agents need minutes or hours to think)
- **Stateless execution** (agents need persistent memory)
- **Edge distribution** (agents need GPU proximity)

This makes them poorly suited for:
- **Long-running reasoning** processes that require extended compute time
- **Persistent state management** across multiple interactions
- **Complex agent workflows** that span multiple reasoning cycles

## What Exactly Is an AI Agent?

<Callout type="info">
For a comprehensive overview of agents and how they differ from traditional software, see our [What is an Agent?](/Guides/what-is-an-agent) guide.
</Callout>

An AI agent is not just another chatbot or API wrapper around an LLM. It's a fundamentally different type of software that combines a LLM with **memory, tools, and a reasoning loop**.

### The Agent Formula
```
Agent = LLM + Memory + Tools + Reasoning Loop
```

Let's break this down:

1. **LLM (Large Language Model)**: The "brain" that understands intent and generates responses
2. **Memory**: Both short-term (conversation context) and long-term (persistent knowledge)
3. **Tools**: Capabilities to interact with external systems, APIs, and data sources
4. **Reasoning Loop**: The ability to plan, execute, observe results, and adapt

### Agents vs. Everything Else

| Traditional API | Chatbot | AI Agent |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| Waits for commands | Responds to messages | Acts autonomously |
| Returns exactly what you ask | Follows scripted patterns | Figures out how to achieve goals |
| Stateless between calls | Maintains conversation context | Remembers everything, learns over time |
| Deterministic output | Limited variation | Adapts based on context |
| Single request-response | Turn-based conversation | Continuous reasoning and action |

Think of it this way:
- **APIs** are like vending machines - push button, get result
- **Chatbots** are like scripted receptionists - they can talk, but only follow a script
- **Agents** are like smart assistants - they understand goals and figure out how to achieve them

## The Paradigm Shift: From Deterministic to Non-Deterministic

<Callout type="info">
For deeper insights on this shift, read our [Agent Engineering](/Guides/agent-engineering) guide that covers thinking like an agent builder.
</Callout>

Traditional software engineering is built on determinism - given the same input, you always get the same output. We write explicit logic for every scenario:

<CodeExample py={`# Traditional deterministic approach
def process_customer_request(request_type, data):
    if request_type == "refund":
        if data["amount"] < 100:
            return process_refund(data)
        else:
            return escalate_to_manager(data)
    elif request_type == "complaint":
        return create_ticket(data)
    # ... hundreds more conditions`} js={`// Traditional deterministic approach
function processCustomerRequest(requestType, data) {
  if (requestType === 'refund') {
    if (data.amount < 100) {
      return processRefund(data);
    } else {
      return escalateToManager(data);
    }
  } else if (requestType === 'complaint') {
    return createTicket(data);
  }
  // ... hundreds more conditions
}`} />

Agent engineering embraces non-determinism - the agent interprets intent and figures out the best approach:

<CodeExample py={`# Agent-based approach
async def handle_customer_request(request, context):
    # Agent interprets the request
    intent = await analyze_intent(request)

    # Agent decides on approach
    plan = await create_action_plan(intent, context.customer_history)

    # Agent executes with available tools
    result = await execute_plan(plan, context.available_tools)

    # Agent learns from outcome
    await update_knowledge(result, context.memory)

    return result`} js={`// Agent-based approach
const handleCustomerRequest = async (request, context) => {
  // Agent interprets the request
  const intent = await analyzeIntent(request);

  // Agent decides on approach
  const plan = await createActionPlan(intent, context.customerHistory);

  // Agent executes with available tools
  const result = await executePlan(plan, context.availableTools);

  // Agent learns from outcome
  await updateKnowledge(result, context.memory);

  return result;
};`} />

This shift requires a new mindset:
- **Design for intent**, not implementation
- **Embrace variability** as a feature, not a bug
- **Think in capabilities**, not functions
- **Trust but verify** - use guardrails and observability

## Why Agents Need Agent-Native Infrastructure

[Microsoft's analysis](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/05/19/microsoft-build-2025-the-age-of-ai-agents-and-building-the-open-agentic-web/) confirms that "most organizations aren't agent-ready" because their infrastructure wasn't built for autonomous systems.

### The Infrastructure Mismatch

Traditional cloud platforms face fundamental limitations when running agents:

| Traditional Cloud | What Agents Need | The Gap |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| 15-second timeouts | Long-running processes | Agents timeout mid-thought |
| Stateless by default | Persistent memory | Agents forget everything |
| Distributed to edge | GPU proximity | High latency to AI models |
| Pay per request | Continuous operation | Costs explode unexpectedly |
| Human-centric monitoring | Agent observability | Can't debug agent decisions |

Major cloud providers like AWS, Google, and Microsoft are working to adapt their platforms for agents.

But retrofitting existing infrastructure is like turning a highway into an airport - technically possible, but not optimal.

## Enter Agentuity: The Agent-Native Cloud

<Callout type="info">
Learn more about the Agent-Native Cloud paradigm in our [Agent-Native Cloud](/Guides/agent-native-cloud) guide.
</Callout>

While others retrofit, Agentuity was built from day one specifically for agents. Agentuity's agent-native platform puts AI agents at the center of everything.

### The Agentuity Difference: Purpose-Built for Agents

Instead of asking "How do we make Lambda work for agents?", we asked "What would infrastructure look like if agents were the only thing that mattered?"

Agentuity provides what agents actually need:

- **Long-running processes**: Agents can think for hours, not seconds
- **Persistent memory**: Built-in [key-value](/Guides/key-value), [vector](/Guides/vector-db), and [object storage](/Guides/object-storage)
- **Agent-to-agent communication**: Seamless and secure [channels between agents](/Guides/agent-communication)
- **Native observability**: Track agent decisions with [built-in tracing](/Guides/agent-tracing)
- **Automatic scaling**: Based on agent workload, not request count
- **Framework agnostic**: Run agents on any framework (LangChain, CrewAI, custom, etc.), and combine them in multi-agent projects
- **Easily integrate with popular tools**: Including the Vercel AI SDK for streamlined AI development, a personal favorite of ours for TypeScript projects

The result is a platform where agents are first-class citizens, not adapted workloads; memory and state are built-in, not bolted on; long-running is the default, not an exception; and agent communication is native, not a hack.

## Your First Agent: From Zero to Production

### Environment Setup

<Callout type="info">
For detailed setup instructions, see our [Getting Started Guide](/Introduction/getting-started) and [CLI Installation Guide](/CLI/installation).
</Callout>

Before we start building, make sure you have:
- Python 3.9+ or Node.js 18+
- Basic command line knowledge
- An Agentuity account (free tier is fine)

Install the Agentuity CLI:

```bash
# NPM (if you have Node.js)
npm install -g @agentuity/cli

# Bun (if you have Bun)
bun install -g @agentuity/cli

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew tap agentuity/tap && brew install agentuity

# Universal installer (Windows/Linux/macOS)
curl -fsS https://agentuity.sh | sh

# Verify installation
agentuity --version

# Login to your account
agentuity auth login
```

### Local Development with DevMode

<Callout type="info">
DevMode is Agentuity's local development environment that provides instant feedback, complete observability, and a web interface for testing agents. Learn more in our [DevMode Guide](/Guides/devmode).
</Callout>

Start DevMode to test your agents locally:

```bash
agentuity dev
# Opens at http://localhost:3500 with a web interface
```

You'll use DevMode throughout the tutorial below to test each step as you build your agent.

### Build Your First Agent Step-by-Step

Work through these steps to build your first agent. Each step adds new capabilities - follow along by creating a project (`agentuity create`), or read through to understand the patterns.

### Step 1: Create a Basic Agent

<TutorialStep number={1} title="Create a Basic Agent" estimatedTime="3 minutes">

Let's start with the simplest possible agent - it accepts a name and returns a greeting:

<CodeFromFiles snippets={[
  { path: "/examples/training/01-intro/step1-basic-agent.ts", lang: "ts", title: "TypeScript" },
  { path: "/examples/training/01-intro/step1-basic-agent.py", lang: "python", title: "Python" }
]} />

**What this demonstrates:**
- Basic request/response pattern
- JSON input handling
- Simple response generation
- Core agent structure (AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext)

**Try it yourself:** Create a new project with `agentuity create`, replace the default agent code with the code above, and run `agentuity dev` to test it.

</TutorialStep>

### Step 2: Add Observability

<TutorialStep number={2} title="Add Observability" estimatedTime="3 minutes">

Now let's add logging so we can see what's happening inside our agent:

<CodeFromFiles snippets={[
  { path: "/examples/training/01-intro/step2-with-logging.ts", lang: "ts", title: "TypeScript" },
  { path: "/examples/training/01-intro/step2-with-logging.py", lang: "python", title: "Python" }
]} />

**What changed:**
- Added `context.logger.info()` calls to track agent behavior
- Logs appear in DevMode and dashboard
- Helps debug and monitor agent execution

**Key insight:** In non-deterministic systems like agents, observability is critical. You need to see what the agent is doing and why.

**Try it:** Run this version in DevMode and watch the logs appear in real-time.

</TutorialStep>

### Step 3: Add State Management

<TutorialStep number={3} title="Add State Management" estimatedTime="5 minutes">

Let's make the agent remember how many times it has greeted people using Agentuity's built-in key-value storage:

<CodeFromFiles snippets={[
  { path: "/examples/training/01-intro/step3-with-state.ts", lang: "ts", title: "TypeScript" },
  { path: "/examples/training/01-intro/step3-with-state.py", lang: "python", title: "Python" }
]} />

**What changed:**
- Uses `context.kv.get()` to read state
- Uses `context.kv.set()` to update state
- Checks `result.exists` to handle first-time execution
- State persists across invocations

**Key insight:** Agents need memory to be truly useful. Agentuity provides built-in key-value storage so you don't need external databases for simple state.

<Callout type="info">
We cover all storage APIs later in [Module 3: Agent Memory](/Training/developers/03-agent-memory). You can also read more by checking out our guide on [Key-Value Storage](/Guides/key-value).
</Callout>

**Try it:** Call this agent multiple times. Watch the counter increment and persist across calls.

</TutorialStep>

### Step 4: Add Error Handling

<TutorialStep number={4} title="Add Error Handling" estimatedTime="5 minutes">

Agents need defensive error handling to gracefully handle invalid inputs:

<CodeFromFiles snippets={[
  { path: "/examples/training/01-intro/step4-with-errors.ts", lang: "ts", title: "TypeScript" },
  { path: "/examples/training/01-intro/step4-with-errors.py", lang: "python", title: "Python" }
]} />

**What changed:**
- Try/catch blocks around JSON parsing
- Input validation (checks for valid name)
- Graceful error responses
- Defensive storage handling (continues even if storage fails)

**Key insight:** Agents interact with unpredictable inputs and external systems. Error handling ensures they fail gracefully and provide useful feedback.

**Try it:** Send invalid JSON or missing data to see how the agent handles errors.

</TutorialStep>

### Deploy Your Tutorial Agent

Now that you've built and tested your agent locally, deploy it to Agentuity's agent-native infrastructure:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```

Your agent will be:
- Running in long-running infrastructure (no timeout worries)
- Storing memory persistently (survives restarts)
- Fully observable (logs and traces in the dashboard)
- Auto-scaling based on load

</div>

This lab project includes:
- Error handling and input validation
- Multiple input types (JSON and text)
- Personal statistics tracking per user
- Memory management with TTL-based expiration
- DevMode test scenarios via `welcome()` function
- Complete `agentuity.yaml` configuration

After cloning the lab, try the following:
1. Run `agentuity dev` to start DevMode
2. Use the clickable prompts from the `welcome()` function
3. Test with both JSON and text inputs
4. Call the agent multiple times with the same name to see statistics
5. Monitor the logs to see detailed operation tracking
6. Check the key-value storage to see the personal greeting counts
7. Check the Sessions tab for performance metrics

<Callout type="info">
This complete implementation shows patterns you'll use throughout the training modules. Notice how we handle errors gracefully, store data efficiently, and provide rich observability.
</Callout>

### Testing Your First Agent

1. **Start DevMode:**
```bash
agentuity dev
```

2. **Test with the clickable prompts** from the `welcome()` function in the lab examples
3. **Try different inputs:**
   - Valid JSON: `{"name": "Alice"}`
   - Plain text: `"Bob"`
   - Invalid data to test error handling
4. **Call multiple times** with the same name to see the greeting counter increment
5. **Monitor observability:**
   - Check the Logs tab to see structured logging
   - View the Sessions tab for performance metrics
   - Inspect key-value storage to see persisted counts

## Key Takeaways

- **Agents are different**: They're autonomous systems, not just API wrappers around LLMs
- **The market is massive**: $47B by 2030, with many developers already building agents (you're now one of them!)
- **Infrastructure matters**: Traditional cloud wasn't built for agents' unique needs
- **Non-determinism is a feature**: Agents adapt and reason, they don't just execute
- **Agentuity is agent-native**: Purpose-built infrastructure for agents, not retrofitted

## What's Next?

You've just built and deployed your first agent on infrastructure designed specifically for agents. In the next module, we'll dive deeper into the anatomy of an agent - understanding planning, reasoning loops, tool invocation, and how agents really work under the hood.

But first, take a moment to experiment with your agent. Try:
- Calling it with different names and at different times
- Checking the logs in the DevMode interface
- Calling it multiple times to see the counter increment
- Testing error cases like missing names
- Monitoring the key-value storage in the dashboard

Remember: you're not just learning a new framework, you're learning a fundamentally new way to build software. Welcome to the age of agents!
