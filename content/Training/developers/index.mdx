## Why AI Agents, Why Now?

The AI industry is racing toward a [$47B agent economy by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-agents-market-15761548.html), but [many developers](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-agents-2025-expectations-vs-reality) are trying to build autonomous systems on infrastructure designed for websites. 

Agents are autonomous systems that remember context, reason through problems, act independently, and collaborate with other agents. This course teaches you **agent engineering fundamentals** while leveraging Agentuity's purpose-built infrastructure.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have deployed:
- Production agents with persistent memory (stateful, long-running)
- Multi-agent workflows with seamless agent-to-agent communication
- Framework-agnostic agents (LangChain, CrewAI, or custom)
- Fully observable systems with OpenTelemetry tracing
- Complete dev → staging → production deployment pipelines

## Time Investment
- **Full course:** ~20 hours (all modules + capstone project)
- **Fast track:** ~8 hours (Modules 1, 3, 6 + mini-project)
- **Framework migration:** ~4 hours (Modules 2 + 6 for developers with existing agent projects)

## Before You Start

**Required:**
- Proficiency in Python or JavaScript
- Basic understanding of APIs and cloud deployment
- Command line familiarity

## Choose Your Path

### New to AI Agents?
Start with [Module 1: Introduction to Agents](./01-introduction-to-agents) to understand how agents differ from traditional software and why they need specialized infrastructure.

### Built Agents Before?  
Jump to [Module 3: Agent Memory](./03-agent-memory) to see how Agentuity handles state differently, or [Module 4: Agent-to-Agent Collaboration](./04-agent-collaboration) for orchestration patterns.

### Need Production Deployment?
Go straight to [Module 6: Deployment Environments](./06-deployment-environments) to understand Agentuity's dev/staging/prod environments and scaling approach.

### Migrating from Another Platform?
Check our Framework Migration Guide for specifics on moving from AWS Bedrock, Google ADK, or Azure AI.

## What Makes This Different

Unlike generic AI courses, this curriculum:
- Focuses on **production deployment**, not just demos
- Addresses real challenges like memory management, cost optimization, and non-determinism
- Uses actual industry examples (both successes and cautionary tales)
- Teaches **platform-agnostic concepts** alongside Agentuity-specific implementation
