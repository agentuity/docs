# Quickstart

When you create your default project, Agentuity tries to show off a lot of the things available in the Agentuity cloud and developer platform. The template demonstrates the AI Gateway, threads, state management, logging, agent communication, and APIs—giving you a comprehensive view of what's possible.

## The Translation Use Case

The default template is built around a translation use case. This was chosen intentionally because it's immediately understandable—as soon as you see it, you know what it does. This clarity makes it easy to jump in and explore the APIs and agents without getting lost in complex domain logic.

## Workbench: Your Agent Simulator

One of the standout features is the Workbench—invariably, you're going to be building agents and you need to test them, so you need a simulator. That's exactly what Workbench provides. It's a built-in testing environment where you can interact with your agents during development.

## See Everything Working

As soon as you run the project—especially when you deploy it—you'll see everything just working in the Agentuity cloud. The dashboard populates with your deployed agents, sessions, analytics, and more.

## Developer Experience

The quickstart is designed around developer experience. It's really easy and quick—meant to be fast to get started. The entire focus is on removing friction so you can go from zero to a running agent in minutes.
