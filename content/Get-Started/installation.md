# Installation

Agentuity provides a convenient install script designed to deliver the best developer experience possible. The goal is to make setup as easy and simple as it can be—whether you're a developer running commands manually or an agent handling the setup on your behalf.

## Simple Installation

The easiest way to get started is with a simple curl command that you can drop into your terminal. This command installs everything you need to start building with Agentuity.

## Agent-Friendly Setup

Agentuity is purpose-built for agents, and that includes the installation and setup process. Good developer experience equals good agent experience—everything is designed with agents in mind.

You can drop a setup prompt directly into your coding agent, and it will handle the entire installation for you. The agent will install the CLI script (which humans can run manually too), prompt you to log in with literally one click back and forth, and get you ready to create and deploy projects.

## Quick Start After Installation

Once you're logged in, getting up and running is just two commands: one command to create a project, and one command to deploy. That's it—you're ready to go.

The entire experience is designed to be really easy and simple, removing friction so you can focus on building agents rather than wrestling with setup.
