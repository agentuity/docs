# React Hooks

Agents, routes, and frontend hooks are the three big building blocks for building agentic software. Back to end-to-end type safety—what was happening over and over is someone was building an agent and saying "I need APIs" (which Agentuity offers), then "now I need a frontend for this agent or these things." So Agentuity built a client-side frontend package as well.

## The React Package

There's a React package, with more packages coming for other frameworks. It's easy to set up—you get a hook, point it right to a route, it's type-safe, invoke it and you're done.

## Minimal Friction

It just makes it so easy to set things up without a lot of fuss. The hooks handle the underlying HTTP calls, WebSocket connections, and Server-Sent Events while exposing a clean, React-friendly API. This lets you focus on building your frontend rather than wiring up API integrations.
