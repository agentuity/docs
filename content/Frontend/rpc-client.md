# RPC Client

In addition to React hooks, there's also an RPC client. It's another fairly ergonomic way to interact with APIs—pretty straightforward to use.

## When to Use It

The RPC client is ideal for non-React applications like Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript. It also works great for server-side JavaScript, Node.js scripts, background jobs, or CLI tools that need to interact with your API.

## Full Type Safety

The RPC client gives you a type-safe way to call your API routes from any JavaScript environment. Types are auto-generated from your route definitions, so you get full IntelliSense and compile-time checking without any manual type maintenance.
