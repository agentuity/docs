## v0.0.84 ⚠️

<Callout type="info">
  Released: May 14, 2025
</Callout>

**Added:**

- Added AGENTUITY_SDK_KEY ([#42](https://github.com/agentuity/sdk-py/pull/42))

<a id="breaking-changes"></a>**⚠️ Breaking Changes**

The environment variable for API authentication has changed from `AGENTUITY_API_KEY` to `AGENTUITY_SDK_KEY`. You will need to update any references to this environment variable in your code and deployment configurations.

For example, the following changes are required:

```diff
- os.environ["AGENTUITY_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
+ os.environ["AGENTUITY_SDK_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
```

When using the Agentuity CLI, it will detect this change and ask if you would like assistance migrating your code automatically.

If you're using an Agentic code editor (such as Cursor, Windsurf, etc.), you can use this prompt to update your code with these changes:

```
The Agentuity SDK v0.0.115 has renamed AGENTUITY_API_KEY to AGENTUITY_SDK_KEY.
Please find all instances of AGENTUITY_API_KEY in my code and replace them with AGENTUITY_SDK_KEY.
```

## v0.0.83

<Callout type="info">
  Released: May 9, 2025
</Callout>

**Fixed:**

- Fix issue vectors, better typing for Vector and KeyValue in context ([#40](https://github.com/agentuity/sdk-py/pull/40))

## v0.0.82 ⚠️

<Callout type="info">
  Released: April 30, 2025
</Callout>

<a id="changes"></a>**Changes:**

- Add support for streaming data to and from agents.  This includes streaming data to the agent via the `data` object and streaming data from the agent via the `stream` property of the `AgentResponse` object.
- The `trigger` property of the `AgentRequest` object will have the value `agent` when the request is invoked by another agent.
- The `AgentContext` object now has a `scope` property that will have the value of `local` when the context is local or `remote` when agent is being invoked by another agent remotely. In the case of agent-to-agent invocation or handoff within the same project, the scope will be `local`.
- Deprecated the local `/run/:agentId` route since the updated `/:agentId` route now supports streaming data to and from the agent directly. This route will be removed in a near future release.

<a id="breaking-changes"></a>**⚠️ Breaking Changes**

The `data` object of `AgentRequest` has changed to support fully streaming data and this required a breaking change. Most of the property accessors are now async functions to support the streaming use case.  You can read more about this change in [Pull Request #38](https://github.com/agentuity/sdk-py/pull/38).

For example, the following code changes are required to get the request data as text:

```diff
- text = req.data.text;
+ text = await req.data.text();
```

For example, to get the request data as JSON, you need to make the following changes:

```diff
- json = req.data.json;
+ json = await req.data.json();
```

See the following documentation [Pull Request](https://github.com/agentuity/docs/pull/114) for specific SDK changes.

If you're using an Agentic code editor (such as Cursor, Windsurf, etc.), you can use this prompt to update your code with these changes:

```
The agents in the agents folder use an older version of the Agentuity SDK which assume the req.data object has properties on it like req.data.json

The new way to do this is with a promise. eg. `await req.data.json()`

The breaking change is here:  https://github.com/agentuity/sdk-py/pull/38

Review this PR, make a plan to change the agents to the latest agentuity SDK with async await support, and execute on it.
