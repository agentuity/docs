## Install the CLI

```bash
curl -sSL https://v1.agentuity.sh | sh
```

This installs the `agentuity` CLI globally on your system.

<Callout type="info" title="Alternative: Install via Bun">
If you prefer package managers: `bun add -g @agentuity/cli`
</Callout>

## Create a Project

```bash
agentuity create
```

The CLI will prompt you to select a template and configure your project.

## Start the Dev Server

```bash
agentuity dev
```

Your project is now running at `http://localhost:3500`. The dev server includes hot reload, so changes to your agents and routes are reflected immediately.

<Callout type="info" title="Bun Required">
Agentuity projects run on [Bun](https://bun.sh). If you don't have Bun installed, the CLI will prompt you to install it when you create your first project.
</Callout>

### CLI Shortcuts

While the dev server is running, use these shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` | Show help |
| `c` | Clear console |
| `r` | Restart server |
| `o` | Show API routes |
