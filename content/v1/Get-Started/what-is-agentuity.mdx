Agentuity is a full-stack platform for building, deploying, and operating AI agents.

Write TypeScript, define routes, and deploy with a single command. We handle the infrastructure, from automatic scaling to built-in observability and more.

Here's a basic example to get you started:

```typescript
import { createAgent } from '@agentuity/runtime';
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const agent = createAgent({
  schema: {
    input: z.object({ message: z.string() }),
    output: z.object({ response: z.string() }),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, input) => {
    const { text } = await generateText({
      model: openai('gpt-5-mini'),
      prompt: input.message,
    });
    return { response: text };
  },
});

export default agent;
```

This agent uses the AI SDK to call OpenAI and respond to messages. Deploy with `agentuity deploy` and it scales automatically. Call it from any frontend, CLI, or other agent.

## What You Get

- **Routes & Triggers** — HTTP, WebSocket, SSE, cron, email, SMS
- **Storage** — Key-value, vector, object storage, durable streams
- **Observability** — Logging, tracing, real-time analytics
- **[AI Gateway](/Build/Agents/ai-gateway)** — Route LLM calls through OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more
- **Evaluations** — Automated quality checks that run after each agent execution
- **Frontend** — Deploy React apps alongside your agents

## How It Works

Each agent has two files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent.ts` | Business logic with schema validation |
| `route.ts` | HTTP routing (built on Hono) |

Infrastructure like cron schedules and email handlers are defined in code, not config. Rolling back a deployment restores the exact configuration from that version.
