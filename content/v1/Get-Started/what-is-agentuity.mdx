title: What is Agentuity?
description: The full-stack platform for building, deploying, and operating AI agents
---

Write TypeScript, define routes, and deploy with a single command. We handle the infrastructure, from automatic scaling to built-in observability and more.

Here's a basic example:

```typescript
import { createAgent } from '@agentuity/runtime';
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { s } from '@agentuity/schema';

const agent = createAgent('Chat', {
  schema: {
    input: s.object({ message: s.string() }),
    output: s.object({ response: s.string() }),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, input) => {
    const { text } = await generateText({
      model: openai('gpt-5-mini'),
      prompt: input.message,
    });
    return { response: text };
  },
});

export default agent;
```

This agent uses the AI SDK to call OpenAI and respond to messages. Deploy with `agentuity deploy` and it scales automatically. Call it from web apps, other agents, or any HTTP client.

## What You Get

- **Routes & Triggers**: HTTP, WebSocket, SSE, cron, email, SMS
- **Storage**: Key-value, vector, object storage, durable streams
- **Observability**: Logging, tracing, real-time analytics
- **[Console](https://app-v1.agentuity.com)**: Visual dashboard for deployments, logs, and more
- **[AI Gateway](/v1/Build/Agents/ai-gateway)**: Route LLM calls through OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more
- **Evaluations**: Automated quality checks that run after each agent execution
- **Frontend**: Deploy React apps alongside your agents

## How It Works

Each agent has two files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent.ts` | Agent logic with schema validation |
| `route.ts` | HTTP routing (built on Hono) |

Infrastructure like cron schedules and email handlers are defined in code, not config. Rolling back a deployment restores the exact configuration from that version.
