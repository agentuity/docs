title: Deploying to the Cloud
description: Deploy your agents to Agentuity Cloud with automatic infrastructure provisioning.
---

Deploy your Agentuity project to the cloud with a single command. The platform handles infrastructure, scaling, and monitoring automatically.

## Deploy Your Project

```bash
agentuity deploy
# or
bun run deploy
```

The deploy command:
1. Syncs environment variables from `.env.production` (or `.env` as fallback)
2. Builds and packages your project
3. Encrypts and uploads the deployment bundle securely
4. Provisions your deployment on Agentuity's infrastructure
5. Activates your deployment

<Callout type="info" title="View in Console">
After deployment, view your environment variables and secrets in the Agentuity Console under **Project > Settings**.
</Callout>

**Example output:**

```
✓ Sync Env & Secrets
✓ Create Deployment
✓ Build, Verify and Package
✓ Encrypt and Upload Deployment
✓ Provision Deployment

Your project was deployed!

→ Deployment ID:  dep_abc123xyz
→ Deployment URL: https://dep-abc123xyz.agentuity.cloud
→ Project URL:    https://proj-456def.agentuity.cloud
→ Dashboard:      https://app-v1.agentuity.com/deployments/dep_abc123xyz
```

The Dashboard URL links directly to the deployment details in the Agentuity Console.

## Deployment URLs

Each deployment gets two URLs:

**Deployment URL** (`dep_xxx.agentuity.cloud`):
- Unique URL for this specific deployment
- Persists even after new deployments
- Use for testing a specific version

**Project URL** (`proj_xxx.agentuity.cloud`):
- Always points to the active deployment
- Updates automatically when you deploy
- Use for stable endpoints and webhooks

```bash
# Deploy creates both URLs
agentuity deploy

# Deployment URL: https://dep-abc123.agentuity.cloud
# Project URL:    https://proj-456def.agentuity.cloud
```

<Callout type="info" title="URL Structure">
Both URLs are automatically provisioned and support HTTPS. The project URL automatically routes to the active deployment.
</Callout>

## Tagging Deployments

Add tags to label deployments:

```bash
# Single tag
agentuity deploy --tag staging

# Multiple tags
agentuity deploy --tag staging --tag hotfix-123
```

Tags appear in deployment lists and help organize versions:

```bash
agentuity cloud deployment list
# Shows tags column for each deployment
```

## Viewing Deployments

List recent deployments:

```bash
# Show 10 most recent
agentuity cloud deployment list

# Custom count
agentuity cloud deployment list --count=25

# For a specific project
agentuity cloud deployment list --project-id=proj_abc123xyz
```

**Example output:**

| ID | State | Active | Created | Message | Tags |
|----|-------|--------|---------|---------|------|
| dep_abc123 | completed | Yes | 12/1/25, 3:45 PM | | staging |
| dep_def456 | completed | | 12/1/25, 2:30 PM | | v1.2.0 |
| dep_ghi789 | completed | | 11/30/25, 5:00 PM | | |

## Deployment Details

View detailed information about a deployment:

```bash
# Show deployment details
agentuity cloud deployment show dep_abc123xyz

# For specific project
agentuity cloud deployment show dep_abc123xyz --project-id=proj_abc123
```

**Output includes:**
- Deployment ID, state, and creation time
- Active status
- Tags and custom domains
- Cloud region
- Git metadata (repo, commit, branch, PR)
- Build information (SDK version, runtime, platform)

```
ID:       dep_abc123xyz
Project:  proj_456def
State:    completed
Active:   Yes
Created:  12/1/25, 3:45 PM
Tags:     staging, hotfix-123

Git Information
  Repo:     myorg/myapp

## Viewing Logs

Fetch logs for a deployment:

```bash
# View logs
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz

# Limit log entries
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz --limit=50

# Hide timestamps
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz --no-timestamps

# For specific project
agentuity cloud deployment logs dep_abc123xyz --project-id=proj_abc123
```

Logs show severity (INFO, WARN, ERROR) and message body with color-coded output.

<Callout type="info" title="Real-Time Logs">
For live streaming logs, use SSH access. See [Debugging](/v1/Reference/CLI/debugging) for SSH setup.
</Callout>

## Rolling Back

Revert to a previous deployment:

```bash
agentuity cloud deployment rollback
```

The command:
1. Finds the previous completed deployment
2. Prompts for confirmation
3. Activates the previous deployment
4. Updates the project URL

```
Rollback to deployment dep_def456? (y/N): y
✓ Rolled back to deployment dep_def456
```

Use for specific projects:

```bash
agentuity cloud deployment rollback --project-id=proj_abc123xyz
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Rollback Behavior">
Rollback activates the most recent completed deployment before the current one. The current deployment remains available at its deployment URL but is no longer active.
</Callout>

## Undeploying

Stop the active deployment:

```bash
# With confirmation prompt
agentuity cloud deployment undeploy

# Skip confirmation
agentuity cloud deployment undeploy --force

# For specific project
agentuity cloud deployment undeploy --project-id=proj_abc123xyz
```

After undeploying:
- The project URL becomes unavailable
- All deployment-specific URLs remain accessible
- Previous deployments are not deleted
- You can redeploy or rollback at any time

<Callout type="warning" title="Undeploy Impact">
Undeploying stops the active deployment immediately. Your project URL will return 404 until you deploy or rollback.
</Callout>

## Removing Deployments

Permanently delete a deployment:

```bash
# Remove a specific deployment
agentuity cloud deployment remove dep_abc123xyz

# For specific project
agentuity cloud deployment remove dep_abc123xyz --project-id=proj_abc123xyz
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Permanent Deletion">
Removing a deployment permanently deletes it. You cannot rollback to a removed deployment.
</Callout>

## Custom Domains

You can configure custom domains using either the configuration file or CLI commands.

### Option 1: Configuration File

Configure custom domains in `agentuity.json`:

```json
{
  "projectId": "proj_abc123xyz",
  "orgId": "org_def456",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "deployment": {
    "domains": ["api.example.com", "app.example.com"]
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Available Regions">
Available regions are fetched from the API at deployment time. If multiple regions are available, the CLI prompts you to select one.
</Callout>

### DNS Configuration

Add a CNAME record for each custom domain. A CNAME record tells DNS to resolve your domain to Agentuity's servers:

```
Type:  CNAME
Name:  api.example.com
Value: p<hash>.agentuity.cloud
TTL:   600
```

The `p<hash>` value is your project's unique identifier, shown when you run `agentuity deploy` or in the Console.

The CLI validates DNS records during deployment:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```

```
✓ Validate Custom Domains: api.example.com, app.example.com
✓ Sync Env & Secrets
...
```

<Callout type="warning" title="DNS Validation">
Deployment fails if DNS records are missing or incorrect. The CLI shows the required CNAME value in the error message.
</Callout>

### Multiple Domains

Custom domains replace the default URLs:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "domains": ["api.example.com"]
  }
}
```

After deployment with custom domains, the CLI only shows custom URLs:

```
→ Deployment ID:  dep_abc123xyz
→ Deployment URL: https://api.example.com
```

The project URL and deployment-specific URLs still exist but custom domains take precedence in the output.

### Option 2: CLI Commands

Manage custom domains directly from the CLI:

```bash
# List configured domains
agentuity cloud domain list

# Add a domain
agentuity cloud domain add api.example.com

# Remove a domain
agentuity cloud domain remove api.example.com

# Verify DNS configuration
agentuity cloud domain verify api.example.com
```

<Callout type="info" title="When to Use Each Approach">
Use the configuration file for domains that should persist across deployments. Use CLI commands for quick testing or temporary domains.
</Callout>

## Environment Variables

The deploy command syncs variables from `.env.production` (or `.env` as fallback):

```bash
# .env.production
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
WEBHOOK_SECRET=secret123
MY_CUSTOM_API_KEY=xxx
```

<Callout type="info" title="AI Provider Keys">
If you're using the [AI Gateway](/v1/Build/Agents/ai-gateway), you don't need to include provider API keys (like `OPENAI_API_KEY`). The gateway handles authentication automatically. Only include provider keys if you're bypassing the gateway.
</Callout>

Variables are automatically:
- Filtered (removes `AGENTUITY_` prefixed keys)
- Categorized (regular env vs secrets based on naming)
- Encrypted (secrets only)
- Synced to cloud before the build step

<Callout type="info" title="Secrets Detection">
Variables with suffixes like `_SECRET`, `_KEY`, `_TOKEN`, `_PASSWORD`, or `_PRIVATE` are automatically encrypted as secrets. All other variables are stored as regular environment variables.
</Callout>

## Deploy Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--tag <name>` | Add deployment tag (repeatable) |
| `-f, --force` | Force deployment without confirmation |
| `--dry-run` | Simulate deployment without executing |
| `--log-level debug` | Show verbose output |
| `--project-id <id>` | Deploy specific project |

```bash
# Verbose deployment
agentuity deploy --log-level=debug

# Multiple tags
agentuity deploy --tag staging --tag v1.2.0

# Specific project
agentuity deploy --project-id=proj_abc123xyz

# Simulate deployment
agentuity deploy --dry-run

# Force deployment
agentuity deploy --force
```
