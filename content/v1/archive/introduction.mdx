[Agentuity](https://agentuity.com) is a cloud platform designed specifically to make it easy to build, deploy, and operate AI Agents at scale.

Our mission is to provide a fully agentic infrastructure and tools necessary to build Agents that are fully operated by AI. That means we allow you to:

- Build agents like you build web apps: define logic, configure routes, and deploy with a single command.
- Focus on agent behavior, while we handle the infrastructure.

With Agentuity, you or your agents can:

- Deploy agents with a single command without configuring IAM roles, load balancers, or security groups
- Connect agents to multiple channels (HTTP, WebSocket, Server-Sent Events, email, SMS, cron, and more)
- Build type-safe agents with schema validation and automated evaluation framework
- Access built-in storage (key-value, vector, object, stream) and observability (logging, tracing, metrics)
- Communicate securely between agents to build multi-agent workflows
- Deploy React frontends alongside agents with hot reload and CDN distribution
- Monitor agent performance with real-time analytics, logs, and OpenTelemetry tracing
- Scale automatically from zero to thousands of requests on-demand

<h3 className="text-base text-cyan-700 dark:text-cyan-300 mb-10">
We see a near future where Agents are the primary way to build and operate software and where all the infrastructure is built uniquely for them.

## Deployment Options

Deploy anywhere—from Agentuity's global edge network to your own infrastructure. The same code runs on public cloud, private VPC, on-premises, or edge devices. See the [Architecture overview](/Introduction/architecture#deployment-targets) for more details.
