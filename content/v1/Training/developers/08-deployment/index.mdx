title: "Module 8: Deployment"
description: From local development to production - deploy agents anywhere
---

You've built agents with state management, multi-agent collaboration, and production-grade quality checks. Now it's time to deploy them.

## Deployment Philosophy

Write your agent code once, deploy it anywhere. The same code runs in local development, public cloud, private cloud, multi-cloud, on-premises, or edge deployments. No code changes required between environments.

### How It Works

The SDK is deployment-agnostic by design. Your agent code stays identical across all deployment targets because the SDK automatically adapts based on environment:

**Local Development (`agentuity dev`):**
- All services (KV, vector, object storage) run locally on your machine
- No authentication required
- Same APIs as production

**Production Deployments:**
- Services connect to configured endpoints
- Same API calls, different backend infrastructure
- Automatic authentication and encryption

**Deployment Targets:**

Each deployment type uses the same agent code but points services to different infrastructure:

- **Public Cloud**: Services at Agentuity-managed infrastructure
- **Private Cloud/Multi-Cloud**: Services in your VPC
- **On-Premises**: Services in your datacenter
- **Edge**: Services on local or edge devices

The SDK handles the differences automatically. For non-public-cloud deployments, you configure where services run via environment variables.

## Environment Progression

Every agent follows the same development path:

```
Local Development → Preview → Staging → Production
```

### Local Development

DevMode (`agentuity dev`) provides the complete Agentuity experience on your machine:

- **Hot Reload**: Instant feedback on code changes
- **Full Observability**: Sessions tab shows execution traces
- **Real Features**: Test with actual storage, state, and agent communication
- **Fast Iteration**: Edit, save, test immediately

This is where you build and debug agents. Everything works exactly as it will in production.

### Preview Deployments

Preview deployments test your changes in the cloud automatically when you create a pull request:

- **Automatic**: Triggered on PR creation
- **Unique URLs**: Each preview gets a URL with git hash identifier
- **Cloud Testing**: Validate changes in production-like infrastructure
- **Team Collaboration**: Share preview links with stakeholders

Preview deployments catch issues before they reach production and enable confident merging.

### Staging Environment

Staging provides production-like infrastructure for final validation:

- **Load Testing**: Test with realistic data volumes
- **Integration Testing**: Validate with external services
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure agents meet latency requirements
- **Configuration Testing**: Verify environment-specific settings

Use staging to validate changes under production conditions before deploying to users.

### Production

Production is where your agents serve real users:

- **Auto-Scaling**: Infrastructure scales with demand
- **Complete Observability**: Same debugging experience as development
- **Regional Options**: Deploy to multiple regions
- **Monitoring**: Track performance and errors

Production deployments can target any of Agentuity's deployment options based on your requirements.

### Environment Validation

Different environments focus on different validation aspects:

| Focus | Development | Preview | Staging | Production |
|-------|------------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Core Features** | ✓ Works | ✓ Change validation | ✓ Load testing | ✓ Success metrics |
| **Performance** | Basic testing | Cloud behavior | Stress testing | Response time |
| **Integration** | Mock APIs | Real APIs | Full integration | User experience |
| **Observability** | Debug info | Cloud traces | Telemetry accuracy | Performance insights |
| **Resilience** | Basic recovery | Team testing | Failover tests | Incident response |

## Deployment Options

Agentuity supports five deployment targets. Choose based on your requirements—your agent code works everywhere without changes.

### Public Cloud

**Managed infrastructure with automatic scaling**

Agentuity-managed infrastructure with global edge deployment:

- Deploy with one command
- Automatic scaling from zero to thousands of requests
- Sub-100ms cold starts
- Multi-region load balancing

**Use when:**
- Getting started with Agentuity
- Building MVPs or prototypes
- Standard compliance requirements are sufficient
- You want to focus on agent development rather than infrastructure

---

### Private Cloud

**Deploy to your own VPC**

Run agents in your own cloud infrastructure:

- Full infrastructure control
- Data never leaves your VPC
- Automatic scaling within your environment
- Supports AWS, Azure, and GCP

**Use when:**
- You have data sovereignty requirements
- Regulatory compliance requires it (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)
- You need custom networking or security policies
- Your organization requires infrastructure control

---

### Multi-Cloud

**Deploy across multiple cloud providers**

Run agents across different cloud providers:

- Deploy to any combination of AWS, Azure, GCP
- Data stays within your chosen infrastructure
- Mix providers based on region, features, or cost
- Automatic scaling per provider

**Use when:**
- You want to avoid vendor lock-in
- You need provider-specific features in different regions
- You require multi-region redundancy across providers
- Your organization has a multi-cloud strategy

---

### On-Premises

**Deploy to your own datacenter**

Run agents entirely within your own infrastructure:

- Complete control over hardware and networking
- Data never leaves your infrastructure
- Supports VMware, Kubernetes, and bare metal
- Air-gapped deployments supported

**Use when:**
- You have air-gapped environment requirements
- You need complete data control
- You're integrating with legacy systems
- Government or defense requirements mandate it

---

### Edge

**Deploy to edge devices**

Run agents at the network edge or on local devices:

- Deploy to Raspberry Pi, laptops, or edge servers
- Data processed locally
- Optional sync with central services
- Minimal latency for local operations

**Use when:**
- You need sub-10ms latency
- You're building IoT or embedded applications
- You need offline-first capabilities
- You're processing data at the source (retail, manufacturing, field deployments)

---

## Regional Deployment

For applications requiring global reach, deploy to multiple regions simultaneously. Regional deployment enables load balancing between regions and provides failover capabilities for high availability.

Use regional deployment for global SaaS applications, high-availability requirements, and latency-sensitive applications with worldwide users.

## Choosing Your Deployment

**Decision Framework:**

| Requirement | Recommended Option |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Just getting started | Public Cloud |
| HIPAA/SOC2 compliance | Private Cloud |
| Air-gapped networks | On-Premises |
| Multi-region redundancy | Multi-Cloud |
| Sub-10ms latency | Edge |
| Data sovereignty | Private Cloud or On-Premises |
| Vendor lock-in concerns | Multi-Cloud |
| Global scale + speed | Public Cloud (multi-region) |

**Recommendation:**

Start with **Public Cloud** for development and initial production. It requires minimal configuration and provides the complete Agentuity feature set.

**Evolution path:**

As requirements evolve, you can migrate or expand to other deployment options:
- Move to **Private Cloud** when compliance requires it
- Add **Multi-Cloud** for redundancy or provider flexibility
- Use **On-Premises** when data sovereignty is mandatory
- Deploy to **Edge** when latency is critical

**Typical progression:**

1. **Development**: Local development with `agentuity dev`
2. **Initial Production**: Public cloud deployment
3. **Scale & Compliance**: Private cloud or multi-cloud as requirements dictate
4. **Specialized Needs**: Edge or on-premises for specific use cases

## Real-World Deployment Patterns

### Enterprise Scale: Salesforce

When Salesforce deployed agents to handle 50% of support cases, they learned critical lessons about production deployment:

**Gradual Rollout:**
- Started with 1% of tickets
- Monitored closely and iterated
- Expanded to 50% over time

**Human Oversight:**
- Agents flagged uncertain responses initially
- Support staff validated agent decisions
- Continuous improvement based on feedback

**Key Lessons:**
- Start small and expand gradually
- Monitor closely during initial rollout
- Plan for organizational change, not just technical deployment
- Iterate based on real-world performance
