## Why AI Agents, Why Now?

The AI industry is racing toward a [$47B agent economy by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-agents-market-15761548.html), but [many developers](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-agents-2025-expectations-vs-reality) are trying to build autonomous systems on infrastructure designed for websites.

Agents are autonomous systems that remember context, reason through problems, act independently, and collaborate with other agents. This course teaches you **agent engineering fundamentals** while leveraging Agentuity's purpose-built infrastructure.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have deployed:
- Production agents with persistent memory (stateful, long-running)
- Multi-agent workflows with seamless agent-to-agent communication
- Framework-agnostic agents (works with Mastra, Vercel AI SDK, custom implementations, etc)
- Fully observable systems with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) tracing
- Complete dev → staging → production deployment pipelines

## Before You Start

**Required:**
- Proficiency in TypeScript or JavaScript
- Basic understanding of APIs and cloud deployment
- Command line familiarity

## Choose Your Path

### New to AI Agents?
Start with [Module 2: Anatomy of an Agent](/v1/Learn/Training/developers/02-anatomy-of-an-agent) to understand the core components of an agent and how they work together.

### Built Agents Before?
Jump to [Module 3: Specialized Routes & Triggers](/v1/Learn/Training/developers/03-specialized-routes-triggers) to see how Agentuity handles different interaction patterns, or [Module 6: Agent Communication](/v1/Learn/Training/developers/06-agent-communication) for multi-agent orchestration patterns.

### Need Production Deployment?
Go straight to [Module 8: Deployment](/v1/Learn/Training/developers/08-deployment) to understand Agentuity's deployment options and how to go from local development to production.

### Migrating from Another Platform?

## What Makes This Different

Unlike generic AI courses, this curriculum:
- Focuses on **production deployment**, not just demos
- Addresses real challenges like memory management, observability, and guardrails
- Provides industry insights and best practices
- Teaches **platform-agnostic concepts** alongside Agentuity-specific implementation
