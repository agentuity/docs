title: Explore the Kitchen Sink
description: The fastest way to see what's possible with Agentuity
---

New to Agentuity? The Kitchen Sink is a collection of 30+ working agents that demonstrate every SDK feature. Deploy it, send messages, watch responses, and copy the patterns that work.

**Why start here:**
- See features in action before reading documentation
- Test patterns in a live environment
- "Learn by doing" with working code examples

## What You'll Explore

### Foundations

Core patterns that every agent uses:

- **Request & Response** — Access input data, return different content types
- **Handler Context** — Logging, storage access, agent communication
- **Storage** — Key-value, vector search, object storage
- **AI Gateway** — Multiple LLM providers, BYO API keys

### Routes & Triggers

Different ways to invoke your agents:

- **Agent-to-Agent** — Direct communication between agents
- **API Routes** — REST endpoints with middleware
- **Cron Jobs** — Scheduled execution
- **Email & SMS** — Message-triggered agents
- **WebSockets** — Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Server-Sent Events** — Streaming updates to clients

### Real-World Examples

Production-ready patterns you can adapt:

- **Chat Agent** — Conversational AI with message history
- **Slack Bot** — Workspace integration with thread support
- **Discord Webhooks** — Server notifications
- **Teams Bot** — Microsoft Teams integration
- **Telegram Bot** — Messaging platform integration
- **Streaming Responses** — Progressive LLM output
- **Composio Tools** — External service integrations
- **LLM-as-Judge** — AI-powered evaluation

### v1-Exclusive Features

New capabilities in the v1 SDK:

- **Evaluations** — Binary pass/fail and scored quality checks
- **Session & Thread State** — Persistent conversation context
- **Subagents** — Parent-child agent hierarchies
- **App Lifecycle Events** — Hook into agent start, complete, error

### Observability

Monitor and debug your agents:

- **Structured Logging** — Multiple log levels with context
- **OpenTelemetry Tracing** — Distributed tracing with spans

## How It Works

1. **Deploy** — One-click deployment to your Agentuity account
2. **Open Workbench** — Interactive testing environment in your browser
3. **Send messages** — Talk to each agent to see features in action
4. **Read the code** — Source code is available for every example
5. **Copy patterns** — Use working implementations in your projects

## Quick Start

Once deployed, open the Workbench to:

- **Ask the `kitchen-sink` agent** questions about any platform feature
- **Try suggested prompts** from each agent to see capabilities
- **Watch logs in real-time** to understand execution flow
- **View responses** to see how each agent behaves

<Callout type="info">
Keep the source code open alongside the Workbench UI to follow along as you test each feature.
