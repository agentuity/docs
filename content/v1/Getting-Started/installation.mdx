## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** or **Bun** (recommended)
- A code editor

## Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @agentuity/cli
```

Or with Bun (recommended):
TODO: not sure our stuff works with anything BUT Bun...need to double check this, but I think we're "tied to Bun" as my CEO said recently.

```bash
bun install -g @agentuity/cli
```

## Create a Project

```bash
agentuity new my-project
cd my-project
```

The CLI will prompt you to select a template and configure your project.

## Start the Dev Server

```bash
bun dev
```

Your project is now running at `http://localhost:3500`.

<Callout type="info" title="Dev Mode">
The dev server includes hot reload, so changes to your agents and routes are reflected immediately.
