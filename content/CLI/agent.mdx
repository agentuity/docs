# Agent Commands

The `agent` commands allow you to create, list, and delete agents in your Agentuity project.

## agent create

Creates a new agent in your project.

### Aliases

`agentuity agent new` (shortcut for `agentuity agent create`)

### Usage

```bash
agentuity agent create
```

This command will prompt you for:
- The name of the agent
- A description of what the agent does

After providing this information, the command will:
1. Create the agent in the Agentuity Cloud
2. Set up the necessary local files for the agent
3. Update your project configuration to include the new agent

### Example

```bash
$ agentuity agent create
What should we name the agent? MyNewAgent
How should we describe what the MyNewAgent agent does? This agent processes customer support requests
✓ Agent created successfully
```

## agent list

Lists all agents in your project.

### Aliases

`agentuity agent ls` (shortcut for `agentuity agent list`)

### Usage

```bash
agentuity agent list
```

This command will display a list of all agents in your project, including:
- Agent name
- Agent ID
- Agent description
- Status (whether the agent exists locally, remotely, or both)

### Example

```bash
$ agentuity agent list

## agent delete

Deletes one or more agents from your project.

This command will:
1. Display a list of all agents in your project
2. Allow you to select one or more agents to delete
3. Ask for confirmation before deleting the selected agents
4. Delete the selected agents from both the Agentuity Cloud and your local project
