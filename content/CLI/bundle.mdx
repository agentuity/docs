The `bundle` command allows you to create a bundled version of your Agentuity project for deployment.

## bundle

Runs the build bundle process for an Agentuity project.

**Aliases:** build

**Usage**

<CLICommand command="agentuity bundle" />

**Flags:**
- `--deploy` - Whether to deploy after bundling
- `-d, --dir string` - The directory to the project (default ".")
- `-h, --help` - help for bundle
- `-i, --install` - Whether to install dependencies before bundling
- `-p, --production` - Whether to bundle for production

> You generally don't need to use this command as it is automatically called when you run `agentuity dev` or `agentuity deploy`.
