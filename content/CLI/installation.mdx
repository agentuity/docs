The Agentuity CLI is a command line tool for managing your Agentuity projects. It's a cross-platform tool that can be used on Windows (using WSL), MacOS, and Linux.

### Install Script

The easiest way to install the Agentuity CLI is to use the install script. This script will automatically detect your operating system and install the appropriate version of the CLI.

<CLICommand command="curl -fsS https://agentuity.sh | sh" />

<Callout type="warn">
  The install script for Windows only works in the <strong>WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)</strong> environment
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  On MacOS, if you have Homebrew installed, the install script will automatically use brew for installation.
</Callout>

    ### Version

To print the version of the Agentuity CLI:

<CLICommand command="agentuity version" />

You can also use the `-v` flag to print the version:

<CLICommand command="agentuity -v" />

To check if you have the latest version of the Agentuity CLI:

<CLICommand command="agentuity version check" />

## Shell Completions

The Agentuity CLI provides shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell. These can help make your command line experience more efficient by providing tab-completion for commands and options.

### Automatic Setup

When you install the CLI using the installer scripts, completions are automatically set up for:
- **Bash and Zsh** on MacOS and Linux (when you have write permissions to the completion directories)

### Manual Setup

You can manually set up completions for any supported shell using the `agentuity completion` command.

<Tabs items={['Bash', 'Zsh', 'Fish']}>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current bash session:

    <CLICommand command="source <(agentuity completion bash)" />

    To load completions for every new session:

    For Linux:
    <CLICommand command="agentuity completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/agentuity" />

    For MacOS:
    <CLICommand command="agentuity completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/agentuity" />

    Note: This depends on the `bash-completion` package. If not already installed, you can install it via your OS's package manager.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current zsh session:

    <CLICommand command="source <(agentuity completion zsh)" />

    To load completions for every new session:

    For Linux:
    <CLICommand command='agentuity completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_agentuity"' />

    For MacOS:
    <CLICommand command="agentuity completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_agentuity" />

    If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment, you need to enable it:

    <CLICommand command='echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc' />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current fish session:
