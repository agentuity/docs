The Agentuity CLI is a command line tool for managing your Agentuity projects. It's a cross-platform tool that can be used on Windows (using WSL), MacOS, and Linux.

## Why Use the Agentuity CLI?

The CLI provides the fastest way to:
- **Deploy AI agents** to the cloud in minutes
- **Manage projects** and environments locally and remotely  
- **Test agents locally** before deploying to production
- **Access cloud services** like vector memory and AI gateway
- **Automate workflows** with scripting and CI/CD integration

### Install Script

The easiest way to install the Agentuity CLI is to use the install script. This script will automatically detect your operating system and install the appropriate version of the CLI.

<CLICommand command="curl -fsS https://agentuity.sh | sh" />

<Callout type="warn">
  The install script for Windows only works in the <strong>WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)</strong> environment
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  On MacOS, if you have Homebrew installed, the install script will automatically use brew for installation.
</Callout>

### Version

To print the version of the Agentuity CLI:

<CLICommand command="agentuity version" />

You can also use the `-v` flag to print the version:

<CLICommand command="agentuity -v" />

To check if you have the latest version of the Agentuity CLI:

<CLICommand command="agentuity version check" />

### Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version of the Agentuity CLI:

<CLICommand command="agentuity upgrade" />

For more details on the `version` command, see the [CLI Version Commands](/CLI/version).

## Manual Installation

You can also manually download and install the Agentuity CLI from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/agentuity/cli/releases) for any platform:

1. Visit the [Agentuity CLI releases page](https://github.com/agentuity/cli/releases)
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system
3. Extract the downloaded file
4. Add the executable to your system PATH

## Source Code

The source code for the Agentuity CLI is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/agentuity/cli).

## Shell Completions

The Agentuity CLI provides shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell. These can help make your command line experience more efficient by providing tab-completion for commands and options.

### Automatic Setup

When you install the CLI using the installer scripts, completions are automatically set up for:
- **Bash and Zsh** on MacOS and Linux (when you have write permissions to the completion directories)

### Manual Setup

You can manually set up completions for any supported shell using the `agentuity completion` command.

<Tabs items={['Bash', 'Zsh', 'Fish']}>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current bash session:

    <CLICommand command="source <(agentuity completion bash)" />

    To load completions for every new session:

    For Linux:
    <CLICommand command="agentuity completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/agentuity" />

    For MacOS:
    <CLICommand command="agentuity completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/agentuity" />

    Note: This depends on the `bash-completion` package. If not already installed, you can install it via your OS's package manager.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current zsh session:

    <CLICommand command="source <(agentuity completion zsh)" />

    To load completions for every new session:

    For Linux:
    <CLICommand command='agentuity completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_agentuity"' />

    For MacOS:
    <CLICommand command="agentuity completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_agentuity" />

    If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment, you need to enable it:

    <CLICommand command='echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc' />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current fish session:

    <CLICommand command="agentuity completion fish | source" />

    To load completions for every new session:

    <CLICommand command="agentuity completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/agentuity.fish" />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

**Installation fails on macOS**: Make sure you have Xcode command line tools installed: `xcode-select --install`

**Permission denied errors**: The install script may need sudo access. If you prefer not to use sudo, try manual installation.

**CLI not found after installation**: Make sure the CLI is in your PATH. Try restarting your terminal or running `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc` for Zsh).

**WSL issues on Windows**: Ensure you're running the install script from within WSL, not from Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell.
