## Shell Completions

The Agentuity CLI provides shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell. These can help make your command line experience more efficient by providing tab-completion for commands and options.

### Automatic Setup

When you install the CLI using the installer scripts, completions are automatically set up for:
- **Bash and Zsh** on macOS and Linux (when you have write permissions to the completion directories)

### Manual Setup

You can manually set up completions for any supported shell using the `agentuity completion` command.

  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current bash session:

    ```bash
    source <(agentuity completion bash)
    ```

    To load completions for every new session:

    For Linux:
    ```bash
    agentuity completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/agentuity
    ```

    For macOS:
    ```bash
    agentuity completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/agentuity
    ```

    Note: This depends on the `bash-completion` package. If not already installed, you can install it via your OS's package manager.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current zsh session:

    ```bash
    source <(agentuity completion zsh)
    ```

    To load completions for every new session:

    For Linux:
    ```bash
    agentuity completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_agentuity"
    ```

    For macOS:
    ```bash
    agentuity completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_agentuity
    ```

    If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment, you need to enable it:

    ```bash
    echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
