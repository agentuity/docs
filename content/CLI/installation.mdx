## Shell Completions

The Agentuity CLI provides shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell. These can help make your command line experience more efficient by providing tab-completion for commands and options.

### Automatic Setup

When you install the CLI using the installer scripts, completions are automatically set up for:
- **Bash and Zsh** on macOS and Linux (when you have write permissions to the completion directories)
- **PowerShell** on Windows

### Manual Setup

You can manually set up completions for any supported shell using the `agentuity completion` command.

<Tabs items={['Bash', 'Zsh', 'Fish', 'PowerShell']}>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current bash session:

    ```bash
    source <(agentuity completion bash)
    ```

    To load completions for every new session:

    For Linux:
    ```bash
    agentuity completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/agentuity
    ```

    For macOS:
    ```bash
    agentuity completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/agentuity
    ```

    Note: This depends on the `bash-completion` package. If not already installed, you can install it via your OS's package manager.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current zsh session:

    ```bash
    source <(agentuity completion zsh)
    ```

    To load completions for every new session:

    For Linux:
    ```bash
    agentuity completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_agentuity"
    ```

    For macOS:
    ```bash
    agentuity completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_agentuity
    ```

    If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment, you need to enable it:

    ```bash
    echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current fish session:

    ```bash
    agentuity completion fish | source
    ```

    To load completions for every new session:

    ```bash
    agentuity completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/agentuity.fish
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    To load completions in your current PowerShell session:

    ```powershell
    agentuity completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
    ```

    To load completions for every new session, add the output of the above command to your PowerShell profile:

    ```powershell
    # Create completion directory if it doesn't exist
    $profileDir = Split-Path -Parent $PROFILE
    $completionDir = Join-Path -Path $profileDir -ChildPath "Completion"
    if (-not (Test-Path -Path $completionDir)) {
        New-Item -Path $completionDir -ItemType Directory -Force
    }

    # Generate completion script
    agentuity completion powershell > "$completionDir/agentuity.ps1"

    # Add to profile if not already there
    if (-not (Select-String -Path $PROFILE -Pattern "agentuity.ps1" -SimpleMatch -Quiet)) {
        Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value "`n# Agentuity CLI completion`n. '$completionDir/agentuity.ps1'"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
