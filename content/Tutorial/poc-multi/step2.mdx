# Authenticate with Agentuity

Your agent will use Agentuity's gateway to access LLM services, so you don't need to configure API keys directly. Instead, you need to be authenticated with Agentuity.

If you're not already logged in, run:
```bash
agentuity auth login
```

This will authenticate you with the Agentuity platform and allow your agent to access LLM services through the gateway.
