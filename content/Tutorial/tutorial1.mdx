# Build a Customer Support Agent

In this tutorial, we'll build a smart customer support agent using the Agentuity TypeScript SDK. Our agent will handle emails, store customer data, search knowledge bases, and provide intelligent responses.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18+ or Bun installed
- An Agentuity account (sign up at [app.agentuity.com](https://app.agentuity.com))
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript

## Tutorial Overview

We'll build our customer support agent step by step, each building on the previous:

1. **Basic Agent Setup** - Create a simple agent that responds to requests
2. **Email Processing** - Handle incoming customer support emails
3. **Customer Data Storage** - Store and retrieve customer information
4. **Knowledge Base Search** - Search for relevant support articles
5. **File Management** - Handle attachments and generate files
6. **Email Responses** - Send personalized replies to customers
7. **Agent Communication** - Route complex issues to other agents
8. **Logging & Monitoring** - Track performance and interactions

## Step 1: Basic Agent Setup

Let's start by creating a basic agent that can respond to requests. This will introduce you to the core Agentuity agent structure.

### Understanding the Agent Structure

Every Agentuity agent has three main components:
- **`request`**: Contains the incoming data and metadata
- **`response`**: Provides methods to create different types of responses
- **`context`**: Gives access to storage, logging, and other services

### Your First Agent

Replace the content of your `Tutorial/index.ts` file with this code:

```typescript
import type { AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext } from "@agentuity/sdk";

export default async function CustomerSupportAgent(
  request: AgentRequest,
  response: AgentResponse,
  context: AgentContext
) {
  // Log that we received a request
  context.logger.info("Customer support agent received request");
  
  // Get the trigger type to understand how this agent was invoked
  const triggerType = request.trigger;
  
  // Log some basic information about the request
  context.logger.info("Request details", {
    trigger: triggerType,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
  
  // Return a JSON response with basic information
  return response.json({
    message: "Customer Support Agent is ready!",
    status: "active",
    trigger: triggerType,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    version: "1.0.0"
  });
}
```

### Test Your Agent

1. **Run the agent**: From the `Tutorial` directory, run:
   ```bash
   agentuity dev
   ```

2. **Send a test request**: Use the Agentuity DevMode interface to send a request to your agent.

3. **Check the response**: You should see a JSON response like:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Customer Support Agent is ready!",
     "status": "active",
     "trigger": "manual",
     "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
     "version": "1.0.0"
   }
   ```

4. **Check the logs**: Look at the console output to see the logging messages.

### What You Learned

In this step, you learned:

- **Agent Structure**: The basic handler function with `request`, `response`, and `context` parameters
- **TypeScript Types**: Using `@agentuity/sdk` types for type safety
- **Logging**: Using `context.logger.info()` to log information
- **Request Properties**: Accessing `request.trigger` to understand how the agent was invoked
- **JSON Responses**: Creating structured responses with `response.json()`

### Key API Features Used

- **Agent Lifecycle**: Basic handler function structure
- **Logging**: `context.logger.info()` for information logging
- **Response Types**: `response.json()` for JSON responses
- **Request Handling**: `request.trigger` for trigger type information

## What's Next

Great! You've created your first Agentuity agent. In the next step, we'll add email processing capabilities to handle incoming customer support emails.

The agent will be able to:
- Parse incoming emails
- Extract sender information and content
- Handle email attachments
- Prepare for automated responses
