## Overview

Webhooks provide a way to send data to your Agentuity agents or receive data from them. This guide covers how to set up, configure, and use webhooks with your Agentuity agents.

## Setting Up Inbound Webhooks

Inbound webhooks allow external systems to send data to your Agentuity agents.

### Accessing Webhook Configuration

1. Navigate to your agent's dashboard in the Agentuity Cloud Console
2. Click on the "Connections" tab or the webhook icon in the I/O visualization
3. In the "Inbound Webhook" modal, you'll see the webhook URL and configuration options

### Webhook URL

The webhook URL is the endpoint that external systems will use to send data to your agent. It typically looks like:

```
https://agent-id.agentuity.cloud/webhook
```

### Authorization Types

You can configure the authorization type for your webhook to control access:

1. **Public**: The webhook is publicly accessible without authentication
   - This setting makes your webhook accessible to anyone who knows the URL
   - Use this for non-sensitive integrations or testing

2. **Bearer Token**: Requires a bearer token for authentication
   - Clients must include an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
   - Provides improved security over public webhooks

3. **API Key**: Requires an API key for authentication
   - Clients must include an API key in the request headers
   - Recommended for production deployments

### Enabling/Disabling Webhooks

You can enable or disable webhook access to your agent using the toggle switch in the webhook configuration modal:

1. Toggle the switch to "Enabled" to activate the webhook
2. Toggle the switch to "Disabled" to deactivate the webhook without losing your configuration

### Making Requests to Webhooks

To call an agent using its webhook, send an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.

#### Example: Public Webhook

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://agent-id.agentuity.cloud/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, agent!"}'
```

#### Example: Bearer Token Authentication

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://agent-id.agentuity.cloud/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, agent!"}'
```

#### Example: API Key Authentication

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://agent-id.agentuity.cloud/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, agent!"}'
```
