# Troubleshooting

This section covers common issues you might encounter when working with the Agentuity JavaScript SDK and provides solutions to help you resolve them.

## Environment Configuration Problems

### API Key Issues

**Issue**: `AGENTUITY_API_KEY is not set` error when running your application.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure you've set the `AGENTUITY_API_KEY` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export AGENTUITY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
2. For local development, you can create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```
   AGENTUITY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
3. Verify the API key is correctly loaded in your application:
   ```typescript
   console.log('API Key set:', !!process.env.AGENTUITY_API_KEY);
   ```

### Project ID Issues

**Issue**: `projectId is required and not found` error when starting your application.

**Solution**:
1. Set the `AGENTUITY_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export AGENTUITY_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   ```
2. Alternatively, you can specify the project ID in your code:
   ```typescript
   await runner(true, './agents', {
     projectId: 'your_project_id'
   });
   ```
3. Check if your `agentuity.yaml` file in the parent directory contains the correct project ID.

### Node.js Version Issues

**Issue**: Errors related to unsupported JavaScript features or syntax.

**Solution**:
1. Verify your Node.js version meets the minimum requirement (v22+):
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
2. If you're using an older version, upgrade Node.js:
   ```bash
   # Using nvm (recommended)
   nvm install 22
   nvm use 22
   
   # Or download from nodejs.org
   ```
3. If you can't upgrade Node.js, consider using a transpiler like Babel to support newer syntax in older environments.

## Authentication Issues

### Invalid API Key

**Issue**: `401 Unauthorized` errors when making API requests.

**Solution**:
1. Verify your API key is correct and not expired.
2. Check if you have the correct permissions for the operations you're trying to perform.
3. Regenerate your API key from the Agentuity Cloud Console if necessary.
4. Ensure the API key is being correctly passed in the Authorization header.

### Permission Issues

**Issue**: `403 Forbidden` errors when accessing certain resources.

**Solution**:
1. Check if your API key has the necessary permissions for the resources you're trying to access.
2. Verify you're using the correct project ID and organization ID.
3. Contact your organization administrator to request additional permissions if needed.

## Agent Deployment Issues

### Agent Not Found

**Issue**: Agent not found or not accessible after deployment.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the agent name matches exactly what's defined in your code:
   ```typescript
   export const config: AgentConfig = {
     name: 'my-agent', // This name must match exactly
     description: 'My agent description'
   };
   ```
2. Check if the agent is properly exported as the default export:
   ```typescript
   export default handler;
   ```
3. Ensure the agent file is in the correct directory structure.
4. Verify the agent has been successfully deployed to your project.

### Agent Initialization Errors

**Issue**: Errors when initializing or starting agents.

**Solution**:
1. Check if your agent handler is properly implemented and exported.
2. Verify all required dependencies are installed.
3. Check for syntax errors in your agent code.
4. Ensure your agent's directory structure matches what's expected by the SDK.

## Storage API Issues

### Key-Value Storage Issues

**Issue**: Errors when using the key-value storage API.

**Solution**:
1. Verify you're using the correct storage name and key.
2. Ensure you're handling binary data correctly:
   ```typescript
   // When storing JSON data
   await context.kv.set('storage-name', 'key', JSON.stringify(data));
   
   // When retrieving JSON data
   const buffer = await context.kv.get('storage-name', 'key');
   const data = JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(buffer));
   ```
3. Check if you're exceeding storage limits or quotas.
4. Ensure TTL values are at least 60 seconds if specified.

### Vector Storage Issues

**Issue**: Errors or unexpected results when using vector storage.

**Solution**:
1. Verify you're using the correct storage name.
2. Ensure your embeddings have the correct dimensionality.
3. Check if your similarity threshold is appropriate (between 0.0 and 1.0).
4. Verify your query text is not empty or too short.
5. Check if you're exceeding storage limits or quotas.

## Performance Issues

### Slow Response Times

**Issue**: Agents respond slowly to requests.

**Solution**:
1. Optimize your agent code to reduce processing time.
2. Use caching for frequently accessed data:
   ```typescript
   // Check cache first
   const cachedData = await context.kv.get('cache', cacheKey);
   if (cachedData) {
     return JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(cachedData));
   }
   
   // If not in cache, compute and store
   const result = await computeExpensiveOperation();
   await context.kv.set('cache', cacheKey, JSON.stringify(result), 3600); // 1 hour TTL
   return result;
   ```
3. Minimize external API calls and database queries.
4. Consider using Bun instead of Node.js for better performance.
5. Monitor your application using OpenTelemetry to identify bottlenecks.

### Memory Leaks

**Issue**: Increasing memory usage over time.

**Solution**:
1. Avoid creating large objects or buffers that aren't properly garbage collected.
2. Use streams for processing large files or data.
3. Implement proper error handling to prevent resource leaks.
4. Monitor memory usage with tools like `process.memoryUsage()`.
5. Consider implementing a restart strategy for long-running processes.

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Debug Logging

To get more detailed logs from the SDK:

```typescript
// Create a more verbose logger
const debugLogger = context.logger.child({ 
  level: 'debug',
  component: 'my-agent'
});

// Use the debug logger
debugLogger.debug('Detailed information', { 
  requestId: '123',
  payload: request.json()
});
```

### Use OpenTelemetry for Tracing

Enable detailed tracing to debug complex issues:

```typescript
// Set up environment variables
process.env.AGENTUITY_OTLP_URL = 'your-otlp-collector-url';
process.env.AGENTUITY_OTLP_BEARER_TOKEN = 'your-bearer-token';

// Use tracing in your code
context.tracer.startActiveSpan('operation-name', async (span) => {
  span.setAttribute('request.id', requestId);
  
  try {
    // Your code here
    span.addEvent('operation.milestone', { timestamp: Date.now() });
    
    // More code
  } catch (error) {
    span.recordException(error);
    throw error;
  } finally {
    span.end();
  }
});
```

### Inspect Network Requests

To debug API calls made by the SDK:

1. Use a tool like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) or [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) to inspect network traffic.
2. Set up a proxy server to intercept and log requests.
3. Use environment variables to point the SDK to your proxy:
   ```bash
   export HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Local Development Server

For local development and testing:

```typescript
import { createServer, createServerContext } from '@agentuity/sdk';

// Create a local development server
const server = await createServer({
  context: createServerContext({
    logger: customLogger,
    tracer: customTracer,
    devmode: true,
    projectId: 'local-dev',
    orgId: 'local-dev',
  }),
  directory: './agents',
  port: 3000,
  logger: customLogger,
});

// Start the server
await server.start();
console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
```

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

| Error Message | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| `AGENTUITY_API_KEY is not set` | Missing API key environment variable | Set the AGENTUITY_API_KEY environment variable |
| `projectId is required and not found` | Missing project ID | Set the AGENTUITY_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID environment variable |
| `No routes found in [directory]` | No valid agent handlers in directory | Check agent file structure and exports |
| `No handler found in [filename]` | Agent file doesn't export a handler | Ensure the agent exports a default handler function |
| `handler returned undefined instead of a response` | Agent handler doesn't return a response | Make sure your handler returns a valid response |
| `ttl for keyvalue set must be at least 60 seconds` | TTL value too low | Use a TTL of at least 60 seconds |
| `invalid payload type` | Unsupported payload type | Use only supported payload types (string, ArrayBuffer, JSON) |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid API key | Check and update your API key |
| `403 Forbidden` | Insufficient permissions | Request additional permissions |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limiting applied | Implement backoff strategy and reduce request frequency |
