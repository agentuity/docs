# Agentuity Python SDK

The Agentuity Python SDK is a powerful toolkit for building, deploying, and managing AI agents in Python environments. This SDK provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools to create intelligent agents that can process various types of content, communicate with each other, and integrate with external systems.

## Installation

First, install the Agentuity CLI:

```bash
curl -sSL https://agentuity.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Then create a new project:

```bash
agentuity new
```

This will set up a new project with the Python SDK already configured.
