# Async API

The Agentuity Python SDK now supports fully asynchronous operations, enabling more efficient handling of concurrent requests and streaming responses.

## Agent Request

The `AgentRequest` class now uses async patterns to handle incoming data:

```python
from agentuity.server import AgentRequest

async def run(request: AgentRequest, response, context):
    # Access request data asynchronously
    data = await request.data.text()
    
    # Access request metadata
    metadata = request.metadata
    
    # Get the trigger type
    trigger = request.trigger
    
    # Return a response
    return response.text(f"Received: {data}")
```

## Agent Response

The `AgentResponse` class supports async streaming and iteration:

```python
from agentuity.server import AgentResponse

async def run(request, response: AgentResponse, context):
    # Stream response data
    async def data_generator():
        for i in range(5):
            yield f"Data chunk {i}\n"
    
    # Return a streaming response
    return response.stream(data_generator(), contentType="text/plain")
```

### Async Iteration

Responses can be iterated over asynchronously:

```python
async def process_response(response):
    async for chunk in response:
        print(chunk)
```

## Data Streaming

The SDK provides several specialized stream readers for different data types:

```python
from agentuity.server.data import (
    StringStreamReader,
    BytesStreamReader,
    EmptyDataReader
)

# Create a stream from a string
string_stream = StringStreamReader("Hello, world!")

# Create a stream from bytes
bytes_stream = BytesStreamReader(b"Binary data")

# Create an empty stream
empty_stream = EmptyDataReader()
```

## Performance Benefits

The async implementation provides several advantages:

- Efficient handling of concurrent requests
- Streaming of large data payloads without blocking
- Reduced memory usage for processing large files
- Better integration with modern async Python applications
