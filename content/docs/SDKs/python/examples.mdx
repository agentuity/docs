This page contains examples of using the Agentuity Python SDK for common use cases.

## Streaming Responses from OpenAI

This example demonstrates how to stream a response from OpenAI using the Agentuity Python SDK:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from agentuity import AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext

client = OpenAI()


async def run(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext):
    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a friendly assistant!",
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": request.data.text or "Why is the sky blue?",
            },
        ],
        model="gpt-4o",
        stream=True,
    )
    return response.stream(chat_completion, lambda x: x.choices[0].delta.content)
```

This example:
1. Imports the necessary libraries from OpenAI and Agentuity
2. Creates an OpenAI client
3. Defines an async `run` function that:
   - Creates a chat completion with streaming enabled
   - Uses the user's input text or defaults to "Why is the sky blue?"
   - Returns a streamed response using Agentuity's `response.stream()` method
   - Uses a lambda function to extract the content from each chunk of the stream

The `response.stream()` method handles the complexity of streaming the response back to the user, making it easy to implement streaming in your agents.
