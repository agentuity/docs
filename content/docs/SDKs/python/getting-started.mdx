# Getting Started with Python SDK

This guide will help you quickly set up and create your first agent using the Agentuity Python SDK.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.10 or 3.11)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (latest version recommended)

## Installation

First, install the Agentuity CLI:

```bash
curl -sSL https://agentuity.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Then create a new project:

```bash
agentuity new
```

## Creating Your First Agent

Create a minimal `agentuity.yaml` file in your project root:

```yaml
project_id: proj_mv0w67c4851eX0oTglYLzP3OgS2BjN54
name: test
agents:
  - id: agent_HaDpiH67c4851eISzbAWfZqwLtnpguW6
    name: myfirstagent
```

Next, create your agent file:

```bash
mkdir -p agents/myfirstagent
touch agents/myfirstagent/agent.py
```

Add the following code to your agent file:

```python
def run(request, response, context):
    return response.text("Hello, world")
```

## Running Your Agent

Start the local development server:

```bash
uv run test.py
```

Test your agent by sending a request:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3500/agent_HaDpiH67c4851eISzbAWfZqwLtnpguW6 --json '{"hello":"world"}'
```
