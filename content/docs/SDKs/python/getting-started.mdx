# Getting Started with Python SDK

This guide will help you quickly set up and create your first agent using the Agentuity Python SDK.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.10 or 3.11)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (latest version recommended)

## Installation

First, install the Agentuity CLI:

```bash
curl -sSL https://agentuity.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Then create a new project:

```bash
agentuity new
```

This will create a new project with a default `agentuity.yaml` configuration file and agent structure.

## Creating Your First Agent

Navigate to the agent file created by the CLI:

```bash
cd agents/myfirstagent
```

Edit the `agent.py` file and add the following code:

```python
from agentuity.server import AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentContext

def run(request: AgentRequest, response: AgentResponse, context: AgentContext):
    return response.text("Hello, world")
```

## Running Your Agent

Start the local development server:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

When the server starts, you'll see a local URL in the console output. Open this URL in your browser to access the Agentuity development UI, where you can test your agent and view the responses.
