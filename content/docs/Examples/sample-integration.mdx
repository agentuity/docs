# Sample Integration Example

This is a simple example showing how to integrate with Agentuity services.

## Basic Setup

```javascript
// Import the Agentuity SDK
import { Agentuity } from '@agentuity/sdk';

// Initialize the client
const client = new Agentuity({
  apiKey: process.env.AGENTUITY_API_KEY
});

// Make a simple request
const response = await client.query({
  prompt: "What's the weather like today?",
  options: {
    temperature: 0.7
  }
});

console.log(response);
```

## Next Steps

After setting up the basic integration, you can explore more advanced features in the [SDK documentation](/docs/SDKs).
