# Cron Jobs

## Overview

Cron jobs allow you to schedule automated tasks to run at specified intervals. In Agentuity Cloud, you can configure cron jobs to trigger your agents according to a schedule, enabling periodic execution without manual intervention.

## Setting Up Cron Jobs

To create a new cron job in Agentuity Cloud:

1. Navigate to your project in the cloud console
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Cron Configuration**
3. Click **Create Cron Job**
4. Configure the job settings:
   - Select the agent to execute
   - Set the schedule using cron syntax
   - Choose the content type
   - Define the payload
   - Enable or disable the job
5. Click **Save** to create the job

## Cron Configuration Options

### Schedule (Cron Expression)

The schedule for your job is defined using standard cron syntax, which consists of five fields:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Content Type

Select the content type for your payload:

- `application/json` - JSON data
- `text/plain` - Plain text
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` - Form URL encoded data
- `text/xml` - XML text
- `application/xml` - XML application data
- `multipart/form-data` - Binary file upload

### Payload

The data that will be sent to your agent when the cron job executes. Format your payload according to the selected content type.

| `*/15 * * * *` | Run every 15 minutes |
| `0 0 * * 1,3,5` | Run at midnight on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday |

## Managing Cron Jobs

Once you've created cron jobs, you can manage them from the Cron Configuration screen:

### View Job Status

The cron jobs table displays:
- Schedule (cron expression)
- Associated agent
- Content type
- Status (enabled/disabled)
- Next scheduled run time

### Available Actions

For each cron job, you can:

- **Manual Run**: Trigger the job immediately, outside of its scheduled time
- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily disable or re-enable the job
- **Edit**: Modify any of the job's settings
- **Delete**: Permanently remove the job

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive payloads that follow the correct format for the selected content type
- Test your cron jobs using the Manual Run feature before relying on the scheduled execution
- Monitor job execution through the session logs to ensure they're running as expected
- For time-sensitive operations, account for potential slight variations in execution time
- Use the most specific schedule that meets your needs to avoid unnecessary executions
