# Project Management

The Projects section of the Agentuity Cloud Console allows you to create, view, and manage your projects. This guide covers the main project management features and common workflows.

## Viewing and Managing Your Projects

When you navigate to the Projects page in the Cloud Console, you'll see a table listing all your projects with the following information:

- **Project Name and ID**: The name of your project and its unique identifier
- **Resource Usage**: CPU and memory usage statistics for your project
- **Agents**: The number of active agents in your project
- **Runs**: The total number of runs
- **Recent Runs**: A visual representation of your most recent 30 runs
- **Actions**: Options to rename or delete the project

Clicking on a project name takes you to the project details page, which provides more comprehensive information and management options for that specific project. The project details page includes several tabs:

- **Overview**: General project information and status
- **Agents**: List of agents in the project
- **Deployments**: Deployment history and status
- **Runs**: Detailed run history and logs
- **Logs**: Project-wide logs
- **Telemetry**: Performance metrics and traces
- **Settings**: Project configuration options

## Creating a New Project

1. Navigate to the Projects page in the Cloud Console
2. Click the "Create Project" button in the top-right corner
3. A dialog will appear with instructions to run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   agentuity project create
   ```
4. Run this command in your terminal and follow the prompts

## Managing Projects

## Best Practices

- **Organize projects by use case**: Create separate projects for different applications or environments
