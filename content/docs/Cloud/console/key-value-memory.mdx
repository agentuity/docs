# Key-Value Memory Storage

The Key-Value Memory Storage section of the Agentuity Cloud Console allows you to create, view, and manage key-value stores for fast, simple, or temporary data storage. This guide covers the main key-value memory storage features and common workflows.

## Understanding Key-Value Memory Storage

Key-value memory storage is designed for fast, simple, or temporary data storage, making it ideal for:

- Session data
- Configuration settings
- Caching
- Temporary state management
- Simple data structures

## Viewing Your Key-Value Instances

When you navigate to the Memory > Key-Value page in the Cloud Console, you'll see a table listing all your key-value instances with the following information:

- **Name**: The name of your key-value instance
- **Size**: The storage size used by the key-value instance

You can filter the list of key-value instances using the search box at the top of the table to quickly find specific instances by name.

## Creating a New Key-Value Instance

To create a new key-value memory storage instance:

1. Navigate to the Memory > Key-Value page in the Cloud Console
2. Click the "Create Memory Storage" button in the top-right corner
3. In the dialog that appears:
   - Enter a name for the key-value instance (using only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores)
   - Select "Key-Value Store" as the storage type
   - Review the description: "Key-value store for fast, simple, or temporary data storage."
4. Click "Provision" to create the new key-value instance
5. Once created, your new key-value instance will appear in the list

## Managing Key-Value Instances

### Viewing Key-Value Instance Details

To view details of a key-value instance:

1. Find the key-value instance in the list
2. Click on the instance name to navigate to its details page

The key-value instance details page includes several tabs:

- **Overview**: General information about the key-value instance
- **Data**: View and manage the data stored in the key-value instance
- **Logs**: View logs related to the key-value instance
- **Settings**: Configure the key-value instance settings

### Key-Value Instance Data

The Data tab allows you to:

- View the key-value pairs stored in your instance
- Add new key-value pairs to your instance
- Edit existing key-value pairs
- Delete key-value pairs from your instance
- Search through your key-value data

### Key-Value Instance Logs

The Logs tab displays:

- Access logs
- Operation logs
- Error logs
- Performance metrics

### Key-Value Instance Settings

The Settings tab allows you to configure:

- Instance name
- Access permissions
- Expiration policies
- Advanced configuration options

## Using Key-Value Memory in Applications

Key-value memory storage can be integrated with your applications using the Agentuity SDK:

```javascript
import { Agentuity } from '@agentuity/sdk';

const client = new Agentuity({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
});

// Store data in key-value memory
await client.memory.keyValue.set('my-kv-instance', 'my-key', 'my-value');

// Retrieve data from key-value memory
const value = await client.memory.keyValue.get('my-kv-instance', 'my-key');

// Delete data from key-value memory
await client.memory.keyValue.delete('my-kv-instance', 'my-key');
```

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive names**: Give your key-value instances clear, descriptive names that indicate their purpose
- **Organize by domain**: Create separate key-value instances for different data domains
- **Monitor size**: Regularly check the size of your key-value instances to manage costs
- **Set expiration policies**: Configure expiration policies for temporary data to automatically clean up unused data
- **Regular maintenance**: Periodically review and clean up outdated or irrelevant data
- **Security**: Ensure sensitive information is properly handled when storing in key-value memory
