The `project` commands allow you to create and manage Agentuity projects.

## project create

Creates a new Agentuity project.

### Aliases

`agentuity create` (shortcut for `agentuity project create`)
`agentuity project new`

### Usage

```bash
agentuity project create [name] [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--dir`, `-d` | The directory to create the project in |
| `--provider`, `-p` | The provider to use for the project |
| `--agent-name`, `-a` | The name of the initial agent to create |
| `--agent-description` | The description of the initial agent |

### Examples

Create a new project with interactive prompts:
```bash
$ agentuity project create my-project
What should we name your first agent? MyFirstAgent
How should we describe what the MyFirstAgent agent does? A simple agent that can generate text
✓ Project created successfully

Next steps:

1. Switch into the project directory at ~/my-project
2. Run agentuity run to run the project locally in development mode
3. Run agentuity deploy to deploy the project to the Agentuity Agent Cloud

🏠 Access your project at https://app.agentuity.com/projects/proj_123456
```

Create a new project with a specific provider and agent:
```bash
$ agentuity project create my-project --provider javascript --agent-name MyFirstAgent --agent-description "A simple agent that can generate text"
✓ Project created successfully
```

## project init

Initializes an existing directory as an Agentuity project.

### Aliases

agentuity project init [directory] [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--agent-name`, `-a` | The name of the initial agent to create |
| `--agent-description` | The description of the initial agent |

### Examples

Initialize the current directory as an Agentuity project:
```bash
$ agentuity project init .
What should we name your first agent? MyFirstAgent
How should we describe what the MyFirstAgent agent does? A simple agent that can generate text
✓ Project initialized successfully
```

## Project Structure

When you create a new Agentuity project, the following structure is created:

```
my-project/
├── .agentuity/
│   └── project.json  # Project configuration file
├── src/
│   └── agents/
│       └── MyFirstAgent/
│           └── index.ts  # Agent handler code
└── package.json
```

### Project Configuration

The project configuration is stored in the `.agentuity/project.json` file. This file contains information about your project, including the agents that are part of the project.

Each agent in your project has a unique ID that is generated when the agent is created. This ID is used to identify the agent in the Agentuity Cloud and in your local project.

Example project configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "provider": "javascript",
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "3c4c0b692533d7807cf0f649ef425dfa29b58bcc99be03e208e52749107fca2e",
      "name": "MyFirstAgent",
      "description": "A simple agent that can generate text"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can add more agents to your project using the `agent create` command. See the [Agent Commands](./agent) documentation for more information.
