description: Command for checking the version of the Agentuity CLI
---

The `version` command allows you to check, display, and upgrade the Agentuity CLI version.

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Display the current version
agentuity version

# Display detailed version information
agentuity version --long
```

The basic command displays the current version number. Using the `--long` flag provides more detailed information including the commit hash and build date.

## Check Subcommand

```bash
# Check if you're using the latest version
agentuity version check

# Check and upgrade to the latest version
agentuity version check --upgrade
```

The `check` subcommand verifies if you're using the latest version of the CLI, and notifies you if an update is available.

## Upgrade Subcommand

```bash
# Upgrade to the latest version
agentuity version upgrade

# Force upgrade even if already on the latest version
agentuity version upgrade --force
```

The `upgrade` subcommand (also available as `agentuity upgrade`) updates your CLI to the latest version. It creates a backup of the current binary before installing the new version.

If the CLI was installed using Homebrew on macOS, it will use Homebrew to perform the upgrade.

The `--force` flag allows you to reinstall even if you're already on the latest version.
