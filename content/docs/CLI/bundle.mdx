The `bundle` command allows you to create a bundled version of your Agentuity project for deployment.

## bundle

Runs the build bundle process for an Agentuity project.

### Aliases

`agentuity build` (shortcut for `agentuity bundle`)

### Usage

```bash
agentuity bundle [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--dir`, `-d` | The directory of the project to bundle |
| `--production`, `-p` | Bundle the project for production deployment |

### Examples

Bundle a project in the current directory:
```bash
$ agentuity bundle
âœ“ Project bundled successfully
ðŸ“¦ Bundle created at: ./.agentuity/bundle
```

Bundle a project in a specific directory:
```bash
$ agentuity bundle --dir ~/projects/my-project
âœ“ Project bundled successfully
ðŸ“¦ Bundle created at: ~/projects/my-project/.agentuity/bundle
```

Bundle a project for production:
```bash
$ agentuity bundle --production
âœ“ Project bundled successfully for production
ðŸ“¦ Production bundle created at: ./.agentuity/bundle
```

## Bundling Process

When you bundle an Agentuity project, the CLI performs the following steps:

1. Reads the project configuration from `.agentuity/project.json`
2. Processes each agent in the project:
   - Reads the agent code from the agent's directory
   - Validates the agent code
   - Bundles the agent code and its dependencies
3. Creates a bundled version of the project that can be deployed to the Agentuity Cloud

### Agent Configuration

The bundling process automatically includes the agent configuration from the project configuration file. You no longer need to export a configuration object from your agent files.

Previously, agent files required an exported configuration object:

```typescript
// Old approach - no longer required
export const config: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'my-agent',
  description: 'My first Agentuity agent'
};
```

With the new approach, agent configuration is managed by the CLI and stored in the project configuration file. Your agent files only need to export the handler function:

```typescript
// New approach - only export the handler function
import { AgentHandler } from '@agentuity/sdk';

const handler: AgentHandler = async (request, response, context) => {
  // Agent code here
  return response.json({ message: 'Hello from my agent!' });
};

export default handler;
```

This simplifies agent development and ensures that agent configuration is consistent across your project.
