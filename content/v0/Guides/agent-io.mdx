## Overview

Agent IO enables your agents to communicate with external platforms through two types of connections: Sources (inbound) and Destinations (outbound). Understanding the distinction between these connection types is essential for properly configuring your AI agents on the Agentuity platform.

## Sources vs Destinations

### Sources (Inbound Connections)

Sources enable bidirectional communication between a platform and your agent. When configured, the platform can trigger your agent and receive responses within the same conversation context.

**How Sources Work:**
1. Platform triggers agent (e.g., @mention in Slack)
2. Agent processes the request
3. Agent responds directly within the same platform conversation

**Example:** When someone @mentions your agent in Discord, the agent can respond back in the same Discord channel.

### Destinations (Outbound Connections)

Destinations allow your agent to send messages to a platform when triggered by *external sources*. These are one-way connections for delivering agent output to specified channels.

**How Destinations Work:**
1. External source triggers agent (webhook, API, schedule, etc.)
2. Agent processes the request
3. Agent sends output to configured destination platforms

**Example:** Your GitHub repository triggers your agent on each commit, and the agent sends a formatted summary to your team's Discord channel.

## Choosing Your Configuration

| Use Case | Configuration Needed |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Chat bot that responds to @mentions | **Source only** |
| Send notifications when something happens | **Destination only** |
| Forward messages between platforms | **Source** for receiving, **Destination** for sending |
| Full assistant with chat and notifications | **Both** Source and Destination |

### Sources Only
Perfect for conversational bots that respond to user questions, @mentions, or direct messages.

**Example:** Your team wants a Slack bot that answers questions about your documentation. You only need a Slack Source - users @mention the bot, and it replies in the thread.

### Destinations Only
Ideal for automated notifications, scheduled updates, or forwarding alerts from monitoring systems.

**Example:** You want GitHub commit notifications in Discord. Configure a webhook to trigger your agent, then add Discord as a Destination. No Discord Source needed since the bot doesn't respond to Discord messages.

### Both Sources and Destinations
Required when your agent needs conversations AND notifications, connecting multiple platforms, or building a full-featured assistant.

**Example:** You're building a team assistant that answers questions in Slack (Source) but also posts daily standup reminders (Destination) and forwards important emails to the channel (Email Source → Slack Destination).

## Key Considerations

- **Sources** provide complete conversational capability - you don't need a destination to reply
- **Destinations** work independently - perfect for one-way notifications
- A single agent can have multiple sources and destinations configured

## Next Steps

- Review the [Agents](/v0/Cloud/agents) documentation for platform-specific configuration
- Configure *sources* for platforms where users will interact with your agent
- Set up *destinations* for platforms where your agent will send notifications
