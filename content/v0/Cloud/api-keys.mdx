## Viewing Your API Keys

When you navigate to the API Keys page in the Cloud Console (under Settings), you'll see a table listing all your API keys with the following information:

- **Name**: The descriptive name you've given to the API key
- **Key**: The actual API key value (hidden by default for security)
- **Expires**: When the API key will expire
- **Last Used**: When the API key was last used
- **Owner**: The user who created the API key

## Creating a New API Key

To create a new API key:

1. Navigate to the API Keys page in the Cloud Console (under Settings)
2. Click the "Create API Key" button in the top-right corner
3. In the dialog that appears:
   - Enter a descriptive name for the key (e.g., "Production API Key")
   - Set an expiration date for the key
4. Click "Create Key" to generate the new API key
5. **Important**: Copy the API key value immediately, as it will only be shown once

Note: An API key is automatically created when you create a new project. You can view and manage this key in the API Keys page.

## CLI

You can use the CLI to manage your API keys using the following command:

<CLICommand command="agentuity apikey" />

See the [CLI documentation](/v0/CLI/apikey) for more information on specific command usage and flags.
