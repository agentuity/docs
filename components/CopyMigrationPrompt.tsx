const MIGRATION_PROMPT = `FULL Agentuity v0 → v1 Migration (Side-by-Side Project)
You are a migration coding agent. Your task is to migrate an Agentuity v0 example project into a new Agentuity v1 project using the official "Migrating from v0 to v1" guide as the single source of truth.

Project Context
The v0 project to migrate is located at:
 @<V0_PROJECT_FOLDER>
This repository contains multiple examples.
 You must only read files that belong to this v0 project.
 You must create the new v1 Agentuity project at the same directory level as the v0 project (a sibling folder).
 Do NOT modify or delete the v0 project.

High-Level Goal
Migrate an Agentuity v0 example project into a new Agentuity v1 project using a strict, phase-based process.
All project creation and filesystem changes must occur only when explicitly instructed in the relevant phase.

CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
Do NOT edit any files in the v0 project


Do NOT guess CLI prompt answers


Do NOT invent APIs, patterns, or abstractions not present in the migration guide


All new code must live only inside the newly created v1 project


Follow migration phases in order


Preserve behavior exactly unless a change is explicitly required by v1



Phase 0 — Authentication & CLI Readiness (REQUIRED)
This phase is a PASS/FAIL gate.
You are NOT allowed to debug, repair, or modify the environment.
ABSOLUTE RULES:
Do NOT inspect node_modules
Do NOT uninstall packages
Do NOT reinstall more than once
Do NOT attempt root-cause analysis
Do NOT retry failed commands
Do NOT infer fixes
Do NOT modify the filesystem
Steps (in order):
Check that the Agentuity CLI is available


Run: agentuity --version


If command is not found, install via:


curl -sSL https://agentuity.sh | sh


Re-check version


Ensure CLI is up to date

Run: bun add @agentuity/cli@latest


If upgrade fails for any other reason, surface the error and stop.


Do not force reinstall unless explicitly instructed


Confirm authentication


Run: agentuity auth whoami


If not authenticated:


Run: agentuity auth login


Wait for the user to complete browser login


Re-run agentuity auth whoami


Once authenticated, proceed immediately


Do not retry


Do not re-check


Do not reinstall again


That's it.
 No filesystem changes. No heuristics.


Phase 1 — Comprehensive v0 Project Scan
Recursively scan all files and folders that belong to the v0 project, including (but not limited to):
src/agent*, src/agents*


src/api*, src/routes*


src/tools/


src/utils/, src/helpers/, src/lib/


Any other files contributing to runtime behavior or business logic


Identify and Categorize
Agent handlers using @agentuity/sdk or AgentHandler


HTTP endpoints or request parsing logic


Tooling modules (tools/, utils/, helpers/, etc.)


Shared helpers or services used by agents


Any usage of:


context.runId


context.getAgent


context.objectstore


KV / Vector stores


Cron, email, or SMS triggers


Output Required
Produce a complete migration inventory listing:
Agents found (with file paths)


Routes / endpoints found


Tool / helper modules and where they're used


Cross-agent calls


Services used


Do NOT begin migration until this inventory is shown.

Phase 2 — Create Fresh v1 Project (CLI-Driven)
Rules for Phase 2
Do NOT prompt for region


Do NOT prompt for template


Do NOT prompt for org


Do NOT retry creation


Do NOT auto-detect templates


Canonical command
agentuity create \\
  --name <v1-project-name> \\
  --region use \\
  --template default

Where:
<v1-project-name> = <v0-project-name>-v1

Example:
tool-calling → tool-calling-v1

That's it.
 If this fails, surface the error and stop.
Directory Semantics (CRITICAL)
The Agentuity CLI creates a new project directory inside the directory passed to it. Therefore:
The directory you pass must be the parent directory, not the final project directory


Do NOT pre-create the v1 project folder


Expect the CLI to create the project folder itself


If the CLI creates a nested directory, detect it and treat the inner folder as the project root


Project Creation Rules
Create the v1 project at the same directory level as the v0 project


Since the user is authenticated, the project must be created and registered with Agentuity Cloud


Dependency Installation Caveat
If dependency installation fails inside the sandbox (for example, due to Bun temp directory permissions):
Explicitly note the failure


Re-run dependency installation outside the sandbox


Continue only once dependencies install successfully



Phase 3 — Prepare v1 Structure
Confirm the new v1 project contains:
src/agent/


src/api/index.ts


v1 runtime dependencies from the scaffold (for example: @agentuity/runtime, @agentuity/schema)


Do NOT remove or modify scaffold files.

Phase 4 — Migrate Agents (Guide Steps 2 + 3)
For each v0 agent, create the file:
src/agent/<agent-name>/agent.ts
Convert
AgentHandler → createAgent()


(request, response, context) → (ctx, input)


response.*() → direct return values


Replace context usage
context.runId → ctx.sessionId


context.logger → ctx.logger


context.kv → ctx.kv


Schema Rules (IMPORTANT — Type Safety)
Define explicit input and output schemas for every migrated agent


Prefer using @agentuity/schema for schema definitions, as it is the v1-native, type-safe approach


Fall back to Zod only when a schema cannot be reasonably expressed using @agentuity/schema


If the v0 agent did not define schemas explicitly, infer the minimal correct schema from actual usage without changing behavior


Additional Rules
Remove all request parsing logic from agent files


Preserve original business logic exactly unless a change is explicitly required by v1


If deprecated imports are detected, replace them with the correct v1-compatible alternatives and explicitly note why the change was required



Phase 5 — Migrate Supporting Files (Tools, Utils, Helpers)
For each non-agent functional file identified in Phase 1:
Recreate the file inside the new v1 project (for example: src/tools/, src/utils/)


Update imports to match the new structure


Do NOT change behavior unless required for v1 compatibility


Ensure all agents and routes reference these files correctly



Phase 6 — Migrate Dependencies
Inspect the v0 project's package.json and extract dependencies and devDependencies.
Cross-reference them against actual imports found in:
Agents


Routes


Tools / utils / helpers


Rules
v0-only dependencies (for example: @agentuity/sdk) must NOT be migrated


If a dependency has a v1 replacement, use the v1 equivalent


If a dependency is general-purpose and still used, add it to the v1 project


Do NOT copy the v0 package.json wholesale


Do NOT remove scaffold dependencies unless you confirm they are unused


Prefer bun install or bun add unless the scaffold indicates otherwise


Output Required
Provide a summary listing:
Removed dependencies


Replaced dependencies


Added dependencies



Phase 7 — Migrate Routes (Guide Steps 4 + 5)
In src/api/index.ts:
Import agents using @agent/<agent-name>


Parse input via c.req.json() or agent.validator()


Call agents using agent.run(input)


Return responses using c.json(), c.text(), or c.body()



Phase 8 — Migrate Services (Guide Step 6)
KV / Vector storage remains unchanged


Replace context.objectstore with Bun S3


Replace expiresDuration with expiresIn


Migrate database usage only if the v0 project already used one



Phase 9 — Agent-to-Agent Communication (Guide Step 7)
Replace context.getAgent with direct imports


Call other agents using otherAgent.run(input)


Remove JSON stringification and manual parsing


Phase 10 — Final Validation
Provide a checklist confirming:
v0 project remains untouched


New v1 project created successfully


All functional files (agents, tools, helpers) migrated


No @agentuity/sdk imports remain


No request/response usage inside agents


Routes live in src/api/index.ts


Services migrated correctly


Typecheck passes


Build passes



Output Requirements
Show progress phase by phase


Include full file contents for any files created or modified


Clearly indicate when user input is required in the terminal
