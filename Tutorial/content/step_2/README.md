# Step 2: Process User Questions with LLM

## Overview
In this step, we'll enhance our agent by integrating OpenAI's LLM capabilities to process and respond to user questions intelligently. We'll transform our basic agent into an interactive AI assistant that can understand and generate human-like responses.

## What You'll Learn
- How to integrate OpenAI API with your agent
- Processing user questions using LLM
- Structuring prompts for effective responses
- Handling API responses and error cases
- Managing conversation context

## Key API Features Used
- **OpenAI Integration**: Using OpenAI API for text processing
- **Prompt Engineering**: Creating effective prompts for LLM
- **Response Handling**: Processing and formatting LLM responses
- **Error Management**: Gracefully handling API errors
- **Context Management**: Maintaining conversation context

Try asking your agent a question and see how it responds using AI!
